Build 14 Beta 4:
- New Features:
  . Specific Free Play Only storyline added by Levis, Pedrwyth, TechnicJelle, Andouce and Pieter Boelen
      > Contains various custom game starts linked to player background profession
      > Includes all sidequests available in the game
      > Possibility to choose from several pre-defined characters
          - Includes the Horatio Nelson, Jean de la Croix, Jean Lafitte and Jack Aubrey characters from previous modpack releases
          - There is at least one navy and one non-navy character available for each nationality
      > Possibility to change starting date
      > Many settings linked to character models as set up in initModels.c
      > Select Storyline Interface adapted as required
  . Improved Nation Relations by Pieter Boelen
      > Relations Tutorial quest added at game start
      > Allow paying governors to make forts forget about you if this has become a problem
      > Player loyalty (Served Nation) impacts game functionality:
          - Loyalty is indicated in the Questbook Interface by the large yellow nation name
          - Random Relation Change code rewritten and fixed
          - Player relations will automatically follow random relation changes affecting his/her Served Nation (but not for Pirate and Personal loyalities)
          - Loyalty is set to your chosen nation at game start
          - Loyalties are updated on each promotion
          - Having multiple Letters of Marque (LoM) will set your loyalty to Personal
          - Large acts of piracy, repeated small acts of piracy and joining the pirates will set your loyalty to the Pirates
          - If your loyalty lies with the pirates, you may be recognized for this by citizens of non-pirate towns
          - When your loyalty lies with the pirates, the only way to undo this is to stop serving the pirates and get a single LoM
      > Relation Changes from player actions completely rewritten:
          - You gain point with a nation only if you have a LoM with them
          - Having multiple LoMs decreases the amount of points you get per nation, though you still get more in total by Grey Roger
          - You lose points with nations allied to the nation you attacked if you have no legal reason to do so or if you have multiple LoMs
          - You lose your LoM if you attack one of your nation's allies
          - Pirates are more forgiving of attacks against them than other nations are, but such an act will still lose you any positive points you had with them
          - You gain points with the pirates through acts of piracy; if you have gained enough points, your loyalties shift to the pirates
          - An unrespectable act is attacking without having a legal reason for it, which applies to ALL ships you sink/capture without having a LoM or navy commission
          - A major act of piracy is actively betraying a nation you were serving or one of their allies or attacking while under a still-friendly flag
      > False Flag detection rewrite
          - Upon loading the scene, correctly set the relations between ALL ships at sea; most other relation-changing code has been deleted
          - Allow changing flags during battle
          - Some towns are tolerant of pirates both at sea and ashore, such as Tortuga and in The Spanish Main also Port Royale
          - This affects the player if you are friendly to the pirates, flying a pirate flag and the town is tolerant of pirates
          - Reset the memory of specific nation forts when buying amnesty, a LoM or on each promotion
          - Call generic functionality for when firing on and hitting friendly ships at sea; skip turning nations hostile when doing this
          - Generic behaviour for firing on friendly ships, including betrayal
          - Flag and betrayal factored into relation change upon capturing/sinking a ship
          - Sinking surrendered ships gives you relation points
          - Custom ship log entry for sinking surrendered ships
  . Skill and Ability System rewritten by Levis

    Strung ropes all over the place and cut some new sails, flags and pennants for the older ships.
    This started out as a project to make the older POTC ships look better then evolved into an effort to reduce the Graphic Anomalies (GA).
    Visually most of the ships have more ropes and better sails which makes them look more realistic and less "empty". It's the difference in GA that is most important.
    Visually the Luggers only have a pennant added, but they are the most important ships because they were causing most of the GA.
    All of the ships in POTC have been looked at from the Naval Cutters to the Man O' Wars. The smaller ships got the most attention with the Light Frigates being changed the most.

[...............................................................]







Build v10.1
-------------
*** YOU MUST RESTART ***
ALL SCALARS MOVED TO NK.C! THEY ARE NO LONGER IN GLOBALS.C!
Now you get dead officers' swords and pistols again. Got changed for some reason on last build.
Per Boocha, Bosun Sounds distances tweaked.
Transfer Interface fixed
Random Encounters disabled when following gold convoy in Larrouse / Mines quest.
Crew who stay after dividing the plunder based on crew share ratio as well as leadership, per Boocha
Isenbrandt Jurcksen will only let you join if you are somewhat famous (you can always switch flag to the Jolly Roger by talking to an officer, though). He will also be kinder (for Jurcksen...) if you are already a pirate.
Now, when you leave the service of a nation / become hostile to a nation, your reputation is checked; if above a minimum, and you were in the service of that nation, your old rank is recorded and you can resume your career after buying amnesty and a LoM. If it's below the minimum, or if you attack a friendly ship with no warning / hoist the Jolly Roger near a friendly ship, land given to you by that country is confiscated and that country's soldiers will attack you. In addition, on leaving service, if your flag is that nation's, a new flag is chosen (the flag of the nation with whom you have the best relations; or, if you have wary or worse relations with every nation, pirate colors).
Mast bug with bought ships fixed.
Hire crew bug fixed by ALexusB (with thanks to Gray Angel)
Pre-Req for Ships v2.0: Ship calls are now based on ID, not index. In the process, ship assignment for coast guard officers is redone to use Pirate Hunting Quest ship assignment code. Same for trade escort ships.
Added Potion use on press of C key by ALexusB
Changed random items code to use all non-quest items (now supports any and all added items).
Changed Itemtraders code again, now supports any and all added items
Added questtext for Patric Cardone quest, by Sailor Al
Reinit now only logs when called by user
NEW: GreatZen/NK - Items. Adds new items, many items now affect skills; added support for armor and three armor types.
Item prices for blades/guns changed again.
Changed schooners' mainmast to use sloop's mast.
Changed time greetings to be time-based
NEW: NK/Sailor Al: Added marriage!
NEW: CouchCaptainCharles's Vice City Mod!
ALexusB: Cannon reloading v2
ALexusB: Islands now appear again during encounters
ALexusB: Improved AI for land battles
ALexusB: Improved ammo choosing AI (tweak and Buildizing by me)
Generated Trade Missions will now no longer assign consumables as goods
Morgan: Musket Volley perk now actually works
Rumor system redone so that quest rumors can be turned on and off at the appropriate times, and, if one is available, it may override the normal rumor selection process.
Added laying up of ships.
Tuned down crew damage from cannonfire
Made mast damage take ship size into account
Fixed bug in Min Crew on transfers
Added laying up of ships--talk to an officer. Only one supported at the moment; and PLEASE only do this on land...
Food and Rum tracking can now be toggled, but you only get 75% of your salary/share if it's /ever/ off during your voyage (or during the month, if in salary mode).
Random turning from storms reduced.
NEW: Kieron Merrett: Corrections v1.0. Includes European fonts, a number of words that should have accents are corrected, and sets the date to 1690 with appropriate flags.

ALL SCALARS MOVED TO NK.C! THEY ARE NO LONGER IN GLOBALS.C!
Note: Pirate Corvette skin is by Akella, not Morgan; the rest are indeed by Morgan. my apologies for the mixup.
=========
Patches:
**v10.1**
Fixed rumor reinit bug. Please reinit.
Fixed transfers (well, fixed my own fix)
Fixed coastguard bug
Rep from rapists encounter increased slightly, but only at lower levels.
Fame needed for marriage tweaked. Will need to be introduced again for this to take effect.
Can no longer buy contraband in stores, only sell it.
Fixed most instances of VC interfering with quests
Added new flag art by KAM


Build v9.2
-------------
*** If you're patching to 9.0 from 8.x, you do not need to restart. But PLEASE REINITIALIZE. If you're willing to restart, download Patch 9.1! It adds some great features.***
Tweaks to various pirate ships, and new skins (see below)
Fearless is now "warship" and non-quest Black Pearl is now "lineship". Both have stats tweaked, are now Class 2. There are now two each per nation (one each for pirates).
NEW: SIX new ships! Textures by Morgan. Pirate Frigate and Corvette, two new Fearless skins, and one new Black Pearl skin (and one copy of that, recolored, by me).
I rewrote the function that gives ships to shipwrights to take advantage of this. They now support any number of added ships, without further changes (i.e. like the Items mod). Shipwrights now have, as the pool of possible ships, all ships of their nation plus all ships with no nation (i.e. tartana, etc.), though of course higher-class ships are rarer. Also, they may have two versions of the same ship, since there are two separate models for most ships. Ships also may be "out of order".
NEW: GreatZen: Fast Travel to Loansharks and QC Port.
Forts now vulnerable, and have crew based on town troops, which is now also based on difficulty.
Fix for officers not being payed correctly on dividing the plunder.
Yet another fix for enemies that don't draw their swords.
Tweak to piercing calcs, so that if blocker's skill is higher it makes a difference.
Fix for Minimum Crew Enforced (finally).
Sell All split into two buttons, sell all, Autobuy ammo/repair/food/rum. File name.c changed to NK.c and now has defines for default ammo/repair/food/rum goods. The ammo is this many shots per gun, the sailcloth/planks is this many units per Hull HP of ship, and the wheat and rum are this many days at full rations (i.e. double this for rum at normal rations).
Dialog heads fixed by Boocha
Arcade Mode tweaked. Now speed is normal, turnrate is doubled, and cannon reload time is halved.
Speed backwinded is increased.
Artois, Nigel, and Lucas set to slot 3 instead of any slot, to avoid problems if you already have officers.
Fixed problem with releasing/executing non-removable characters
Fixed "Moses" typo.
Donate wealth to crew removed, since GreatZen made a much better interface.
Fixed "Hoist pirate flag in battle"
Added Portugal as a nation you can serve.
NEW: Sailor Al: added questrecords to Thomas O'Reily's cargo delivery.
========
Patches:
**v9.1**
NEW: GreatZen: donate money to crew and transfer interface, both available from the Select (F2) menu. THIS REQUIRES A RESTART AFTER INSTALLING
**v9.2**
Fort characters are now generated like other fantoms, and XP from destroying a fort is now based on the fort commander's rank.
The finest spyglass now shows morale too (in a log line, like distance).
Agents (diplomats) now cost more than talking to the governor.
Titles changed to be more realistic (both in those used, and the rankings). Thanks to Heyreddin Barbarossa and Duke Surak'nar.
Various changes to fame (and also then crew-available) calcs, as well as adding a score (based on average fame from all nations).
Score-title now shown on relations screen.


Build v8.3
-------------
*** If you're patching to 8.3, you do not need to restart. But PLEASE REINITIALIZE.***
*** If the game crashes on switching to Sea mode from land, after accepting a Pirate Hunting Quest, reload, press T, and try again. That should fix it. If not, drop me a line. ***
Added Scumdog's soundpack. It adds another meg or so, but it's worth it.
NEW: MareX - Exchange gold in 100gp lots
Mithrandir - Realistic Weather v2! (with a little tweak to windspeeds)
Changed portraits around so no more invisible portraits / clones.
Revamped relations system; replaced VMM. You may now work for as many, or as few, nations as you want; relations now span from hostile to wary to neutral to Letter of Marque/Ranked. You can leave service at any time, but for a rep hit (and watch out if your rep is too low!). Merchants and shipwrights may not trade with you, depending on your reputation and your relations with said merchant/shipwright's country.
Added officer salaries to salary mode (1/5 hiring price), shown on charsheet; companions take 1/2 salary. Player is also payed the same wage, but only if there is enough money (modified by difficulty).
GreatZen and NK: Added land to character and charsheet. It is given with promotions from governors. Land also returns a profit.
Added deductions for officers to DP mode.
Personal share in DP mode based on difficulty level.
Fixed Virgile Boon.
Speed added to spyglasses.
Tweaked wine properties
Ability to raise and lower flags at will; speak to a tavern-hired officer. Note that this will NOT change your relation with nations! You must be neutral or better with the nation to raise that nation's flag; you can always raise the Jolly Roger, however.
Raising a pirate flag via the battle interface will make you hostile only with those nations that are present at that time (and thus can see you do it). Raising a pirate flag via an officer will NOT change your relations.
Change to prisoners: Execution now hurts the player's reputation, but awards XP equal to the ransom.
Towns now have populations, which can increase or decrease over time, depending on the amount of food available. A chunk of the population is killed / leaves town, when you sack the town. Troops in forts, and crew available for hire in taverns, and goods available in stores, are based on town size. Goods' prices are based on the quantity of the good vs. the size of the town, and price updates for each unit of goods purchased. Note: goods price calcs take time--if your game looks like it's frozen up, give it a minute; it's just calculating cost. The town now also has a set amount of gold, which changes based on population size and in trading with the merchant and shipwright; if they don't have enough money, you can't sell...this gold is also used to find how much booty you take when you sack the town (and that gold is then subtracted from the town's gold). XP on sacking is based on number of troops; after sacking a town, population decreases (as does number of troops), and then slowly grows back.
Town gold is displayed on the right side of the "gold bar" when trading with merchants or shipwrights; your party's gold is on the left. When buying and selling goods, the current price to buy or sell a unit of that good is displayed in the center of the bar. The average price per unit is displayed in parentheses after the total price to buy/sell.
Ask a citizen in the streets about the colony; they'll tell you the population.
If town size or goods get screwed up, press I to reset towns to default population, goods, and gold.
========
Patches:
*8.1
Isla Muelle citizens and merchants and the governor now have nation set correctly.
Oxbay Shipwright Oweyn's dialog fixed.
Bugfix to boarding HP
Dynamic prices, based on supply
========
*8.2
Zaid Murro quest log bugfix
Officer salary now modified by player's leadership skill and Iron Will perk, and difficultly level (just like crew salary, but crew salary is based on the best leadership skill and perk selection in the party).
Goods price tweaks
Expedition length now shows in Ship Sheet, when viewing crew.
Typo fixed in switching to salary mode
Typo fixed in morale for salary mode.
Land profit tweaked
Sea experience changed to AddPartyXP to allow for sharing of XP to inactive officers.
Sell All at stores skips ammunition, repair goods, and wheat and rum. Selling a ship at the shipyard (and thus selling all goods on it) does still sell those goods. Thanks to Stone-D for the code and Surak'nar for reminding me.
========
*8.3
Price of Fearless changed to 250k
NEW: When an encounter is created, ships of the correct nation are assigned (though there is a slight chance that a ship not of that nation may be assigned, to keep things interesting).
Added option to turn on and off encounter ship class capping based on player's ship class. It's under difficulty level choice when talking with a tavern officer.
XP Logs do not show for boarding crew and enemy boarding crew
Various monetary tweaks
==========
If you're upgrading from a previous build, or installing a build for the first time, you must start a new game. None of your old saves will work.

Build v7.5
-------------
*** Difficulty Levels have now been implemented ***
*** Falling Masts in Combat by Walker ***

NK - Reinitialize Mod: updated to create a new file called Reinit.c, with a single function, and to reinitialize automatically on starting a new game.
NK - CM/DP Mod: Rewritten so the factors act as scalars rather than add/subtract constants. In addition, the food and rum decrement routines have been rewritten for better, more bug-free, operation. And the gold required for a happy crew has been reduced. Now you can choose whether to pay your crew, or divide the plunder every so often. Talk to a hired tavern-officer to choose. PLEASE REREAD THE DOCS FILE.
NK - New English Governor: updated to fix problem with the mansion being locked. If you want the new governor to appear, you must load a save from (*SPOILER*) after you take Greenford but before you talk to the newly-freed researcher at the lighthouse. (*/SPOILER*) If you're not there yet, don't worry.
NK - Name: default changed back to Nathaniel Hawk.
NK - Fix Cannons: cannon strength and reload time tweaked further, as well as the damage from different types of ammo.
NK - Merchant Ship Mods v3 SD: fixed money bug where money was only given if ship was taken as a prize. Also, money amount halved.
NK - Pirate Frigate: changed model back to Frigate1
NK - Taghmon - Redo Character Generation Code: This mod recodes all random character generation to use Taghmon's officer code with a new Random Enemy officer type, and to correctly equip the characters (with no blade if they shouldn't have one, and not just a saber if they should); this includes the respawning soldiers, who now are based on your rank. Also, chargen for ship captains is now totally redone; and they can now have "virtual" officers, giving them skill bonuses at sea; and it adds a difficulty scalar. Talk to an Encounter (aka Random) Officer and tell him you don't fit in right to change it.
NK - Give Other Captains Virtual Officers: increases the skills--but only while at sea--for captains who are not companions, by giving them "virtual" officers, i.e. increasing their skills by a multiplier semi-randomly based on how many officers the player has enabled and the class of the captain's ship.
NK - Difficulty levels: There are now four difficulty levels. When you start the game, you start on the easiest; hire an officer from a tavern and talk to him to change your difficulty level (if you're not starting a new game, just talk to a hired tavern officer). This scales, on generation, enemy character ranks and HP; officer ranks and HP (inverse of the difficulty), chance for characters to be generated with better blades, and the chance of ship captains having "virtual" officers, to increase their skills.
NK - Make Enc Rank based on Ship Class: checks to see if, for encounter generation purposes, your rank is greater than (8-ship class) * 2 and if so makes rank (8-ship class) * 2. Note that this applies to Pirate Hunting quest enemy generation too.
NK - Items: now harder for enemy characters to get good blades, and in addition scaled based on difficulty. Also, thanks to MareX, you now get gold too. And, gun algorithm rewritten to be like the blade algorithm (non-arbitrary).
Wardobe v3: Includes three new portraits by fragster (since v2), and now switches your model as soon as you choose it. Also includes one new choice, by Sailor Al.
Surak'nar - Adds crew-on-deck for Fearless
Viper - Add Cargo Value to Ship Sale Price
Sailor Al - Quest Log Text for New Quests: for now, only the Blacques are covered, but coming soon there will be Quest text for all re-enabled quests.
NK - Luck in fighting: Luck, and difficulty level, now affects the amount of damage you do.
REMOVED: Stone-D's Shared Experience mod. Caused crashes at various points.
NK - Shared Experience: My version of a Shared Experience mod. When party XP is added, half of full XP goes to each passenger--all if the party has the SXP perk; if the passenger is an officer (or the player), he/she gets the full XP. When personal XP is added, half goes to each officer (including the player), or the full if SXP.
Fix to Edgar Attwood Greenford adventure.
Fix to Pirate Hunting Quests

Sail-to text is back, thanks to Surak'nar.

If you already have build 9-30 installed, all you have to do is load your saved game, reinitialize, and save again. However, you /may/ have to reset controls to defaults and then re-customize them (if you have problems with controls, or the game doesn't respond right to them). If you don't have 9-30 installed, but do have a previous build, read the changelog section for the 9-30 build on how to upgrade.

Build 9-30-03
-------------
Includes all fixes from the 9-24 patch (Rheims quest bugfix, Crew Morale and Div. Plunder fixes, update to Gregor Samsa, SDSM boarding / forts fix).

Quests: Edgar Attwood quests fixed (see Quests Added.txt for a info and a walkthrough if you need one). Also, issue fixed in Zaid Murro/Bandits quest.
New: Minifix - it can no longer rain in the ship's cabin.
NEW: Viper - Emblemed Sails v2.5 Full: An big update of v2, now supports the Xebec Barbarossa and many more sail types.
NEW: NK - Tweak to Rapers Mod: this gives back the rep boost: if your rep is under 80, 1/2 the time you get +1 rep instead of the gold.
NEW: Viper - Missing Children Fix. Like the Play-Past-The-End mod I'd thought I'd included this, and wrote I had in the readme, but hadn't installed it. Now it is.
Verruckt - NK -  Military Mod: Revised required-num-sunk totals for rank advancement. Also, more little bitty wage bugs fixed (now everything is made integers first).
ALexusB - NK - Pirate Hunting for VMM: Fixed bug in dialog; also now pirates are generated just like other ships.
NK - Merchant Ship Mods v3: In addition to its previous changes, you now get a calculated (but somewhat random) amount of money when you successfully board a ship, lots for merchants, some for warships (MoW with a really good captain gives about the same money as a Galleon with a good captain), and a very random amount for pirates (from not very much to even more than the above Galleon). Also, the ransom you're payed when you release captives is changed, so it's based on the character's rank, old ship's weight and class, and a random scalar.
SD - Surrender Mod: Fixed bug in the bugfix, re: boarding ships after boarding forts.
Sailor Al - NK - New Swords v2: Adds four blades total (two new to v2).
NK - Crew Morale and Divide the Plunder: Expedition Length changed to 60-100 days.
NEW: NK - New English Governor: This gives Redmond a new governor after you kill or capture Silehard. I'll let you find out who!. Note that even though this adds a new character, you do NOT need to start a new game!
NEW: Viper - Fast Travel to Port
NEW: Pythagoras - Re-enable SD2 Logo
Viper - Adm.W. - Stone-D: Charsheet v2.0: fix
MASSIVELY NEW: This build uses all but one DLL from the new Russian Patch. This has one issue (see below), but otherwise seems to work great. Including the falling masts!
Also included are AI adjustments and other neat things--check out the readme for the 1.02r Russian Patch in the Russian Patch thread on Pirates Ahoy.

**********NOTE: If you have the 9-23 build working, you do not need to start a new game (though that's often wise, and can't hurt). BUT! You still do have to reinitialize at least once after installing this build, and you *MUST* sell all your items to a merchant, exit the sell interface, and then buy them back. Otherwise Bad Things Will Happen.**********

KNOWN ISSUES:
1. The labels for the items on the sail-to menu do not appear.
2. The dialog-only head models for new characters do not appear. Regular models work fine; it's just the green box in the upper-left corner is empty when talking with a character with a new model.

Build 9-23-03
-------------
SD - Surrender Mod: Fixed bug with boarding forts, and the bug whereby you get only 1 enemy. Fudgefix for now.
Quests: Many bugfixes to the additional quests by Taghmon. Thanks, Taghmon! Also, fixed bug with smuggler who takes you to Machado.
NK - Rep Changes: Firing on friendly ships lowers your reputation.
Verruckt - NK -  Military Mod: Revised required-num-sunk totals for rank advancement (Actually this change was in a previous build but I forgot about it). Also, fixed a longstanding bug in wages code. Thanks, Fred Bob!
NEW: You can no longer tell a ship's nationality on the world map. To compensate, you have a far better chance of having "No" available on the "Engage?" screen, and the chance for it being available is now based not only on sailing skill and luck but also on sailing perks and your speed vs. the encounter's speed.
NEW: Thanks to Sailor Al, KFleshman's Play Past End Mod is now installed (I thought it was already, but actually not).
Minifix to Gregor Samsa's dialog, so he now supports any number of new blades/guns/glasses.
NK - Items assignment mod: now chooses best possible blade for enemy in random encounters (if they meet or beat its rarity), rather than a random blade.
NK - Prices: some prices changed. (weapons prices now 10 * (oldprice/100)^1.5 )
NEW: Sailor Al has a new blade for us, the Cardinal's Guard.
NEW: NK - Crew Morale daily updates and Divide the Plunder are now implemented. Please read the readme for details, it's rather complex.
NEW: NK - Wardrobe: This lets you change what you're wearing, by talking to Malcolm right off the bat, or talking to him again later, or talking to a hired random-officer. You start out in your bathrobe. Note that your portrait does update!
NEW: Thanks to Lord_Kosmos we have two new characters, a Royal Navy captain and admiral.
NEW: Thanks to Kodo_Boon and ALexusB we have Jack Sparrow in the game!
NEW: NK - Fix Trade Quest Bug, where the wrong destination is written down.
NEW: Captain Gull - Bug Fix Loan Shark infinite money: This is a fix to the bug where loans in the game can be infinite.
NEW: NK - Fix Artois-Animists Bug: This MOD fixes a conflict in the Artois quest and Animists quest, and the bug in the Artois quest that results in this.
NEW: ALexusB - Small Font in Dialogs.

A big thank-you to everyone who's contributed to these builds; especially Taghmon and Sailor Al, without whose help this build would not be possible (let alone less bugged than usual, I hope).
