"Welcome to my tavern, stranger. My name is ",
". What brings you to my humble establishment? Do you need a place to rest?",
"Thank you. My name is ",
". I'm here on business.",
"My name is ",
", and you can spare your hospitality. I'm here on business.",
"Welcome, #ssir#! What do you want?",
"I need some information, and I find the local innkeeper is usually the man to ask.",
"I'm looking to hire some sailors for my ship.",
"Point me to the patrons here who might be looking for a job. I need to add to my crew, and I don't mind if they're cutthroats.",
"Do you have a room? I'd like to stay here for a while.",
"Do you have a free bed in this hovel?",
"I don't have any business with you right now. Goodbye.",
"That's true. I hear most everything. What do you want to know?",
"I need a job. Don't you know any rich boys on this island who are afraid to travel alone?",
"I don't have any questions at the moment. Let's talk about something else.",
"Maybe they have. There are many rumors around.",
"Hurry. I'm a busy man.",
"It's a little too late in the day to find good sailors. They'll all be asleep or passed out by now. Come back in the morning - or you can spend the night here at the tavern.",
"All right. Do you have a room?",
"I don't need a room at the moment. Let's talk about something else.",
"I do have a vacancy. How long are you going to stay?",
"Overnight.",
"Just until dark.",
"Fine. That will be 5 gold pieces.",
"All right. Here you go.",
"Sadly, I don't think I can afford anything better than a night in the tavern hall.",
"What - does that come with a personal staff? I'll pass.",
"I'll think about it.",
"Fine. That will be 5 gold pieces.",
"All right. Here you go.",
"Sadly, I don't think I can afford anything better than a night in the tavern hall.",
"That's too much. I'll stay in the tavern hall.",
"I'll think about it.",
"Dear visitors! Please stop this outrage! Don't force me to call the guards!",
"All right, all right! I'm already gone!",
"If he is they prefer to sail in with less satellites, you know this", 
"Yes, I forgot. Alright, I'll come back later, when I have fewer ships, ha-ha.",
"I don't want to help you. You've caused too much trouble for my country.",
"Just look at this patriot. Well, goodbye.", 
"Your hands are covered in blood. You don't seriously think that anyone would travel with you, do you?",
"You are right, everyone's afraid of me! Ha-ha!",
"You arrived just in time. A merchant here was searching for the right company to travel with. You should talk to him. There he is, just coming in to the tavern.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is nobody like that at the moment, Maybe next time.",
"Hmm, then I will wait.",
"Can you help me with something? I'm looking for the French frigate 'La Foudre'. She was supposed to call in here.",
"There have hardly been any ships here lately. We did have a convoy due to appear, but she hasn't showed up.",
"I know. I'm investigating its disappearance.",
"Well I wish you the best of luck in your quest #ssir#.",
"Thank you.",
"Can you tell me if #svillain#, or anyone else from the '#sship#', has been in #sMarigot# recently?",
"Yes, some sailors from the '#sship#' were in here a few nights ago. They were talking about what they'd do in the brothel in #sPointe a Pitre#.",
"So they're heading for #sisland_Guadeloupe# next?",
"That seems to be true, yes. I'll tell you something else\nNext time you're in the port, look out to sea and you'll see a big warship. That's the '#swarship#.'",
"How big is that ship?",
"Big enough that none of the Alliance so-called powers have anything in the Caribbean to match her. She'll clear these seas of France's enemies all by herself, just you see!",
"That's good to know. Well, goodbye. <Thinks: the English navy would probably pay well to know that. If so, I could try my luck at the naval base on #sisland_Antigua#.>",
