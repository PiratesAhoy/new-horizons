"Let's talk about something else.",
"Our colony was built about 40 years ago. The island is pretty small, but it has very fertile soil, and there are a couple of convenient bays.\nNew sections are being developed, and trade has increased. The first settlement was a small outpost on the other side of the island, a rough place which may still be there for all I know. Later, a larger settlement was founded here which eventually became #sCharlestown#.",

"That's clear. Let's talk about something else ",
"Then buccaneers became frequent visitors here, so they built the fort to protect the city.",
"I see. Let's end our conversation on that subject, and change the subject.",
"Most of the island is already developed. It's difficult to develop further because it's hard labor to clear the dense jungle, and we don't have enough people here to do that...",
"All right, tell me something else.",
"There is nothing special on our island. All islands are more or less the same in this archipelago.",
"I see. Continue...",
"We've got jungle, rocks, and deserted beaches...and I guess that's about it. Well, there is also the pirate settlement here, of course.",
"I see. Continue...",
"I see. Let's end our conversation on that subject, and change the subject.",
"I don't know anything.",
"That's too bad. Tell me more about the colony.",
"There is nothing special about the fort. It has thick walls, long-range cannons, and there are 1000 soldiers in the garrison.",
"I see. Continue...",
"Why do you want to know, captain? It's not very smart for me to chatter about the fort with every stranger. How do I know what you have on your mind?",
"Well, if the fort is such a sensitive subject for you, then let's not talk about it. Tell me about the colony.",
"I see. Let's end our conversation on that, and change the subject.",
" We have a population of ",
" citizens.",
