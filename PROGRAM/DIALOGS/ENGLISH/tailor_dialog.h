"My rich uncle has bought ",

" a commission as a Kapitein. Can you make the necessary adjustments to this uniform?",
"Certainly, ",
". If you'll just give me the commissioning papers, I'll start right away.",
"Commissioning papers?",
"Yes. I don't doubt your word, of course. But it's standard policy to require the commissioning papers to prevent any random soldier from trying to get a uniform he is not entitled to wear.",
"Of course. Here they are. <make a play of looking in your pocket> Ah. Hopefully they're still in the barracks, otherwise a pickpocket has helped himself to them and I'll need to get the papers replaced. I'll return when I have them.",
"Here are the papers.",
"Thank you. Yes, these are valid papers for a Kapitein who has just been commissioned into the 3rd Foot Company. I have the required insignia in stock. Come back tomorrow and I'll have the uniform ready for you.",
"Thank you.",
"I am here to ask about the uniform I ordered.",
"Yes, I've been waiting for you. The uniform is now ready. That will be 4000 gold, please.",
"Here is the money.",
"I don't have that much money with me. I'll be back when I do have it.",
"And here is the uniform. I look forward to seeing ",
"you",
"your brother",
" wearing it on duty.",
"Thank you. It will indeed not be long before you see ",
"me",
"my brother",
" putting the uniform to good use.",
"Certainly I can adjust your uniform. But not while you are wearing it!",
"Good point. I'll change into something else first.",
