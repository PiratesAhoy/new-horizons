"What are you doing here, ",
"?",
"Nothing. I'm just having a look around.",
"I'd like to talk about one of your workers.",
"I want to buy the freedom of your worker, ",
"Leborio Drago",
"Leborio Drago",
".",
"Who is it?",
"You mean me?",
"What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy? I've got a huge pile of paperwork to get through.",
"I won't take a lot of your time. Let me ask you just one question.",
"My business is more important than some paperwork. If you want to get back to your work, just answer my question.",
"All right. I can see it's not going to be easy to get rid of you. What do you want to know?",
"I need to know if the clay tablets are still here. The ones with strange characters that were found in the mines some time ago.",
"I may be able to help you. They say that you claim to be a captain?",
"Of course I'm a captain! My name is ",
", and I serve the English crown.",
"Yes...it seems to me I've heard your name before.",
"That's possible. I was here on business recently. I had to take a prisoner out of jail and deliver him to the governor in #sRedmond#.",
"Yes, that's it. The commandant of the jail told me about you.",
"So there you have it. You can free me now, right?",
"It's not that simple. They paid money for you.",
"I see. And how much is it going to cost me to get out of here?",
"You cost 10 gold. But, you know, I'll have some explaining to do when they learn that your strong back has gone missing. So I think 1000 gold is a better sum.",
"Fine. Send a man to my ship in the port, and my people will give you the money.",
"Are you insane? I know I'm worth more than 10 gold, but where do you expect me to get 1000 gold?",
"I'll do that. Be patient.",
"Wait! I'm here on business. Rumor has it some earthen tablets covered in strange symbols were found here.",
"That's true, they were. But I'm afraid you've wasted your visit.",
"Why is that? Did someone take them away?",
"No! Who would want that junk? No, a recent landslide destroyed all but one of those tablets -- and even it is in pieces.",
"That's too bad. Governor ",
"Robert Christopher Silehard",
" will be displeased.",
"Oh! You represent His Excellency? Then I suppose I should tell you that before the landslide, a young man came here and made parchment copies of those tablets.",
"Where can I find him?",
"I'm afraid I can't help you with that, but I know that one of the slaves here was appointed to look after the young man while he examined the tablets. If you can find him and speak to him, he may be able to help.",
"Fine, I'll do that.",
"Then I can't help you. Now leave me in peace!",
"...",
"Who, exactly?",
"I'm interested in a man called ",
"Leborio Drago",
"Leborio Drago",
". I'd like to buy his freedom from the mines.",
"That means nothing to me. I don't know all the prisoners by name.",
"I'll find him myself, then. I just want to know if we can make a deal.",
"I have no reason to refuse you. We're always getting fresh...uh...workers, so the loss of one certainly won't shut down the mines.",
"Fine. Tell me your price.",
"Well, if you're so eager to free him, I could let you do that for 1000 gold.",
"Are you mad? That's a fortune!",
"A good worker costs a lot these days.",
"All right. You've got a deal. Take your money.",
"No person in the world is worth that much, slave or not!",
