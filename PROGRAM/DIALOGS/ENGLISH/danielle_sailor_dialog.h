"Captain! Your bos'n went ashore several minutes ago, said he had some business to do there. He said you should find him.",
"Great. And where should I look for that drunkard?",
"Wait, captain. There's a ship in the bay flying the jolly roger from its mast. I just hope they haven't seen us.",
"Perfect! It's probably the ship I need. If we move fast, we can take it while the crew is in town.",
"That may well be the vessel I'm looking for. Let's get back to the ship and attack it from the sea.",
"Captain, that barque sank very close to shore. We can probably fish its cargo out with little trouble.",
"Excellent. Get to it.",
"Captain, we found these statuettes among the wreckage.",
"Great! Now we can return to #sRedmond#.",
"He said something about the tavern, captain.",
"There's a shock. Get back to the ship. I'll go find him.",
