"Off with you! I'm in no mood to talk to strangers.",
"Don't you want to buy me some rum?",
"On your way. I'm busy.",
"...",
"What?",
"I'm looking for a man named ",
"Raoul Rheims",
"Raoul Rheims",
". He's a captain. Have you seen him?",
"Yes! Yes! I've seen `im with my own eyes! But you'd do better to ask that innkeeper woman - she knows him far better than I do. If you take my meaning, #ssir#.",
"I see. Thanks.",
"Of all the ",
" people on this island, I had to run into you...",
"Hold there, friend. I only need some information on your fair colony here. There might be some rum in it for ya, if you're helpful-like.",
"*sigh* Fine, ask away -- but be quick with it.",
"Hurry it up -- I got some fine grog, fair booty an' adequate wenches waitin' in me cabin.",
"Better get on quick-like, before me rum-fired good cheer wears off.",
"Small as your village is, I still need some directions.",
"Just need to get my bearings is all.",
"Would ye be so kind as to tell me where to find...",
"What can you tell me about this illustrious and wholly legitimate colony of yours?",
"One of your lovely citizens interests me...",
"I came here to find out about someone in town.",
"Be a dear and tell me about someone? Might be a mate of yours.",
"Ugh, I can almost see a corona of stink lines to go with that pocky smell of yers. Nevermind.",
"Who ya got in mind there, eh luv? *scratch*",
"eh? *fart*",
"Why, all mates of mine, they is -- every bleedin' last one of these scoundrels, ha! *burp*",
"Who governs you unruly lot?",
"Your ale-dispenser, barwench, whatever you like to call her.",
"That gentleman who portends to repair seagoing vessels -- oh I'm sorry, are my words too big for ya?",
"He who sells the sails and, uh, stuff.",
"That weasely, wall-eyed tinsmith outside of town.",
"The miss who governs the brothel...",
"Nevermind; no one's worth knowing about on this rock. But I'd like to know something else.",
"Arne? Even for a pirate, that lad is crooked. Plus he was always makin' a foul racket, when he had his shop here behind the stakes -- so we kindly provided him a new shop, OUTSIDE.",
"Very well. Another thing...",
"Thankee, that's all.",
"Isenbrandt? A stern bloke, that one. But he has what it takes to keep things in order here. Picked unanimous-like to lead us dogs.",
"I shall have to pay him a visit. But about another matter...",
"Thanks. So long.",
"Good old Ines. She takes fine care of us rowdy boys. Knows how to dispense wit' what pleases us, like.",
"Sorry to keep you, but there's another thing...",
"Aye, Jakob Nickerson. Just moved into town not too long ago. He does a fair job fixin' boats, plus he has a score to sell.",
"Good. Something else?",
"Not 'he', 'she'. Old Peter Blowhorn retired years ago. His daughter Kate runs the store now. Doesn't cheat ya like old Pete did - well, she don't want ya taking yer business to #sCharlestown#, does she?",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Good to hear. Cheerio.",
"Heh, I see where yer going with this -- followin' yer bowspirit into a friendly port, eh mate, huh, eh? A little of the ol' nudge-nudge, wink-wink, eh friend? heh... Anyway, Celestine -- for that's the 'spectable mistruss's name -- keeps a fine stable o' pretty mares, she does. I think you'll enjoy a visit.",
"Spot-on. Will you bear one question more?",
"Right, what now?",
"I know this island better'n anyone, so yer best to ask me.",
"Knows this place wells, me do. But yer about to know me boot e'en bet'r if ye keeps flappin' on overlongs-like... mate.",
"Oi, I'd sell my ship, my dear mum AND my soul if I could only get a drink...",
"A fine set o' leaks brought me here -- who can set me up with a ship to fill the gaps?",
"Got a merchant here who AIN'T a cheat?",
"Can anyone on this wretched rock mend my bloody sword?",
"A fellow's got needs... if you catch my drift. Where might they be met?",
"Arne -- he's in that hut out there facin' the gates -- is a jumpy, skitterish bugger, and he charges too much, AND he takes too long... come to think of it, you'd best not to bother.",
"I'll take my chances, thankee.",
"And your poor excuse for a shipyard?",
"Who'll buy the old crap out of my hold?",
"Ines' got a tankard waitin' for you on the near side of the big rock what sits in the middle of town.",
"Much obliged, my rude, smelly friend.",
"And where might I have my ship repaired?",
"Supposin' I want to deal in some com-PLETE-ly legal trade?",
"My blade's near to rusting away to naught... can somebody in this town patch it up?",
"Walkin' through the gates, the ship-fixer's hovel is on the rig-- no, the left. Port, right? I always get those two mixed up. One day, says I to meself, I'll learn meself these nautical terms...",
"But more importantly -- where's your ale-house?",
"I need to find someone who'll give me a fair price for my goods.",
"You've been most helpful; that's all.",
"Who serves as blacksmith to you lot?",
"One of the middle homes on the left, facin' the boulders what litter the middle of our streets. That's the left, as ye walk into town.",
"Where's your shipyard?",
"How about the tavern?",
"That's all I can stand of your company, thanks.",
"And what if I were to tell you my sword's not sharp enough to split open a ripe melon?",
"I'm not sure I follow, friend...",
"You know -- certain needs, that a #sgender# possesses from time to time... A #sgender# long at sea, with only the company of #spronoun# mates, who, pretty as some may be, don't go a long way in quenching certain fires that burn in #spronoun# loins?",
"Wot's that? Burnin' loins? I think I might have some ointment here, if that's what you're after... I don't see what else you might be meanin'...",
"Let me spell it out for you, MATE: Where do ye keep yer blasted whores?!",
"Me horse? Why, he's back home in his stable, all munchin' nice-like on hay and oats, fat and pretty as y'please. I don't see what that's got to do with burning loins, however.",
"*sigh* Forget it... looks like it's back to #sonanism# for this lonely sailor.",
"By the by, cap'n, just between the two of us: 'S no ointment or equestrian persuits there, but ye might like to drop by the brothel far side of the boulder, right beside our guv'nor's home. They host a mighty nice game o' dice there. And tell little Lucie a right hello for me, if ye would... *blush... belch*",
"*sigh*",
"Us fellows of low morale fibre are a patient lot -- up to a point. (A sharp and steely point, y'see.) Be quick about it.",
"Right, anything you wanna know -- 'ceptin' where I keeps me stash.",
"Really that in'erested, huh? Most visitors here just kinda cut an' run, if ye ken...",
"I'd like to know the history of the famous pirate island -- much storied, to be sure.",
"What's to be found on this desolate rock besides your village?",
"No, rather, another topic will do, shall we?",
"Aye, storied she is: a fine 'istory o' blood an' guts. But we freebootin', seafarin' folk -- calls ourselves 'Buccaneer Caribbeans', if it please ye -- take good care of our own sort, and as long as ye be flyin' the skull'n'bones, yer a mate of ours. Why, there's ",
"Fascinating... do oblige and tell me more.",
"Perfectly intruiging. But I've other things on my mind just now.",
"This land has been in many hands since the Spanish first settled her, back in ought-six if memory serves. We done wrested this rock from the French last, been some 20 years, and no one's been man enough to try and take her from us. And let 'em try, says I!",
"Quite a story indeed. I'd like to know more about the present state of things, now.",
"Nope, 't'ain't naught else to be found here... just our little settlement, to be sure. And I'd be careful, askin' about our private affairs here, mark me.",
"Hmhm... duly noted. Anything more you know about your island?",
"Well... far side of the island, through some jungly-bits, ye just might stumble on a nice surprise. But I'll keep mum about it for now.",
"How lovely. I should like to know more, if you'll bear with me.",
"Y'din't hear this from me, but... Quite a pretty mansion, there is, just through a spot of jungle yonder. Been deserted these many years, even full of swag as she is, but we're all a'feared to touch it, 'lessen the owner should decide to come back -- a right fearful one that is, we should all think.",
"Oh yeah?",
"You've been unexpectedly, but delightfully, helpful. Could you answer me another one, mate?",
".",
" of us now!",
"I'm looking for a young girl...",
"Who isn't?",
"This is a girl that the pirates kidnapped.",
"What pirates?",
"Oh come on, you look like a very observant and clever young man. Maybe you have noticed a tall girl being taken as a hostage to this town?",
"Alright, I did see them bringing a new girl, a brunette, into the Settlement.",
"What happened to her, where can I find her?",
"Guess they sold her.",
"Like a slave? To whom?",
"Use your imagination traveller...",
"Okay mate, I can't spend all day talking to you. (Bad news - that would be the Brothel I guess!!)",
"I don't know nothing.",
"Maybe there is some gold if you have useful information.",
"How much gold are we talking about?",
"Well let's say 40, and that is only if you know anything of value for me.",
"You seem very eager Captain, why not make it 60?",
"Greedy pirate? I'll give you 50 even though it's far too much.",
"It's 30 or nothing, you pathetic little thief!",
"Take your gold then and start talking or I'll...",
"If you know anything - spit it out or I'll hurt you badly!",
"Do I have to repeat it Captain, I don't know what you're talking about!",
"I'm not afraid of you youngster!",
"Get out of my sight now.",
"Hand 'em over Captain.",
