"I'm sorry! I didn't see you there. Do forgive me.",
"No worries. These things happen. How are sales?",
"What? Sales? Oh, they're...fine....",
"Are you all right?",
"I can see you're busy. I'll let you get back to your work.",
"I'm sorry. Did you say something?",
"What's wrong with you, #ssir#?",
"Nothing important. I just said goodbye.",
"Yes...yes, ",
", I'm fine.",
"You're the man some of the locals say is crazy, aren't you?",
"I'll just be going, then.",
"Wait - I don't know your name...",
"My name is ",
".",
"It's nice to meet you. And I'm ",
".",
"What troubles you, ",
"?",
"It's nice to meet you, but I must be going. Perhaps I'll see you later.",
"It's nothing, ",
". I'm a small man with small problems. They're not worthy of your attention.",
"Why don't you let me decide what's worthy of my attention?",
"You know, that's the sanest thing I've heard from anyone in some time. You're right - I have my own problems to deal with. Yours are no concern of mine.",
"Well, I don't know....",
"What's the harm in just telling me your troubles? Maybe I'll even be able to help.",
"Well, it's your business, of course. I'll leave you alone.",
"All right, I'll tell you. Some time ago, a man who called himself ",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
" came to me. He asked me to buy some Indian statuettes for him which had recently appeared in the archipelago.\nBut I didn't have the money - such pure gold is very expensive in these modern times....",
"They were made of gold?",
"Yes, they were. I'm told they belonged to a collector who found them in the jungle here and decided to take them to Europe.",
"But he didn't manage to do that?",
"I think we've gotten off track here. Let's hear the rest of your story.",
"No, he didn't. His ship was captured by pirates.",
"I see. And what exactly is your problem?",
"Oh, yes. Well, ",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
" offered to front me the money to acquire these statuettes, and I agreed.",
"He paid up front? Didn't that seem suspicious to you?",
"It did...but I was making 10000 gold on the deal. How could I refuse?",
"I'm not sure I'm following. ",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
" tricked you somehow?",
"Sounds to me like your greed got you into trouble, ",
". You'll have to find your own way out of it.",
"Well, to be honest - I don't know.",
"You don't know? Do you have a problem, or don't you?",
"The problem is this: Those statuettes were stolen from me last night. And ",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
" will be here in two days. I'll have to give him the money back.",
"So you give him his money. What's the problem?",
"Don't you see? He's the one who stole those statuettes! This way, he gets them for free.",
"Sorry, ",
", but you did ask me....",
"Relax. I'll find this fellow who robbed you.",
"I didn't ask for your life's story!",
"Oh, thank you! You give hope to a despairing man.",
"Good to know. Now let's talk about the money you'll pay me for my help.",
"You're probably right. I'm inclined to believe that, too. But I have no evidence.",
"We'll get the evidence if it exists. The only thing left to determine is how much I'll get for my help.",
"I don't have much money now. How about 3000?",
"You just told me you made 10000 up front - and you only offer me 3000? I'm going to need at least 50 percent for my services.",
"I'd think you could spare more, but I suppose it's a deal.",
"Well, if you don't help me, I get nothing. So I suppose it's fair.",
"Then we have a deal. By the way, what does this ",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
" look like?",
"No, I can't agree to that.",
"Why not? Without me, you lose everything!",
"I'm not so sure I'll need your help. I spoke to a guard earlier, and he promised to help me.",
"Then I guess we don't have a deal. Lots of luck.",
"Fine, then. 3000 it is.",
"I'll be waiting for news, ",
".",
"Wait, what did this man look like?",
"He's a tall Spaniard with long, black hair and a scar on his face.",
"All right. I'll be seeing you.",
"Greetings, ",
".",
"Hello.",
"Greetings, ",
", how's the mission going?",
"No results yet, but I'm working on it.",
"I've just seen ",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
"! He went into that house to the left of the church!",
"Good. Stay here. I'll go pay him a visit.",
"The weather is nice today, isn't it?",
"As always. Let me see what you have.",
"Maybe it is. I'm too busy to notice. If you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way.",
"Thanks, but I must go now.",
"Can you tell me something about the city?",
"Oh, ",
"! Thank you! A guard was here only minutes ago, and he told me you helped to find the statuettes and arrest Teodoro.",
"I'm happy I could help.",
"Well, how goes it? Teodoro will be here soon!",
"I'm sorry; I couldn't help you.",
"I found the statuettes - and the thief. ",
"In that case, I suppose I'll have to close my doors for good. I was really counting on you, captain.",
"Goodbye.",
"So, did it turn out that ",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
" was the thief?",
"He's the one who hired the thieves. But they're not around to tell about it now.",
"You're a formidable ally, captain! Thanks for your help. Take this money as a token of my gratitude.",
"Farewell.",
"Turn around. The tavern is right behind you, ",
".",
"Thank you. I've got a couple more questions.",
"Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.",
"To find the store, you need to go through the gates to the right of my stall.",
"Thanks. I've got a couple more questions.",
"Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.",
"Then you need to visit the shipyard office. It's to the left from my stall, by the very gates. See that two-story building? Just go up those stairs.",
"Thanks. I've got a couple more questions.",
"Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.",
"You're a formidable ally, captain! Thanks for your help. Tell a guard or officer about it, though, please--I can't leave my stand, and I don't want any unpleasentness to settle on you for dealing with #sLucien#. I think I see one walking around...",
"You're quite welcome. Let me go find him.",
"As you wish. Would you like to see what I have for sale?",
"Certainly. Perhaps you have something I want.",
"Not now, thank you. I'm rather busy, so if you don't mind, I'll be on my way.",
