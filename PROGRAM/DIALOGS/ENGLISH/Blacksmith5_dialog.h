"Eh? You're not with the authorities, are you? I ain't done nothin' wrong. You'll see that.",
"Certainly not, and calm down, man. I just came to call to see if you can do something for my rusty sword here.",
"Oh, that's all right, then. Cuz if you were with the authorities - I ain't done nothin', right? Now, let's see... I'll have to charge you fair, as per my work, see, and that's dependin' on how good you want your sword to be. Give me a couple days (my docket is just so full of legitimate business, heh heh) and I should be done with it. Sound fair? All nice and legal, as I always do?",
"Sounds about right, er - I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. Arne Saknussemm, is it? That's what the sign on the door said. Anyway, listen, have a look at this sword and tell me what you can do, and for what price.",
"You seem wound a little tight today - your eyes even appear to be bulging out slightly. I believe I'll come back another time.",
"Oh-ho-ho, I see how it is! Bringing me a worthless, broken ",
" , just to see if I can tell the difference, and fix such a threadbare blade? I can mend it, I can - you'll see.",
"Maybe you really do need me - that ",
" of yours looks terrible. I can't possibly let you go without fixing it - in good conscience and all, you know.",
"Eh, your, uh, ",
" doesn't look too bad there, sir. Still, I'll patch it up if you're for real.",
"See, now I don't know that you're not lying to me... I saw a ",
" just like yours on some town guard somewhere. So if I'm going to fix it for you, you have to swear you won't try and turn me in - not that I've done anything wrong, mind.",
"Well! In all my years as a perfectly legitimate businessman, I've never seen such a nice-looking ",
". Er, I mean, it certainly looks like it could use a lot of work... ",
"What is this, you bring a perfectly good, untarnished ",
" in here and ask me to fix it? Are you trying to set me up or something? You gotta wake up pretty early to fool me, yessir! Now be gone, kindly.",
"To prove I'm no lawman, Arne, I'll ask you to make this blade the strongest possible - for which I'll hand over the full amount of ",
"Tsk tsk, Arne. Your paranoia doesn't suit you. Anyway, when you're done with this blade I want it perfect - or nearly so. Here's ",
"I could care less whether you are dabbling in illicit business or not. All I want is for this blade to be brought up a notch or two, and I won't pay a doubloon more than ",
"Let's make a deal: You'll only just touch up my blade, and I'll only just part with ",
"Calm yourself, man! I'm rather glad to hear there's nothing you can do for me...",
"If you fear me thinking you a criminal, Arne, you're right to do so. At these prices you'd rob me blind! Argh, I need to go stab someone to sooth my vexation...",
"Well look I, uh, I'm all done, captain. It was all perfectly legal, right? So I won't be seeing you again... unless you need a blacksmith, that is, right?",
"Rest assured I'll return, Arne - for one reason or another.",
"Look, do you wanna get your sword fixed or not? Hurry up and equip something - unles you really ARE with the law...",
"Let me see what you have in stock.",
" pieces of gold.",
"I brought with me quite a lot of blades. Would you be able to put them all in a better condition?",
"Do I look like a multi-armed Indian god? I don't waste my time repairing your crew's forks and clubs so they can break them on someone's head again. But my apprentices could help you out.",
"Please have them repair the most damaged blades, so each is at least of average quality. Take these ",
"If they could bring the blades up to good quality, I'd pay you ",
"I hope your apprentices know their trade. I'll only accept fine quality. Here's your ",
"I'm not quite sure what blades you are talking about.",
"Sorry, never mind.",
"What exactly do you want me to do with that rusty antiquity!?!? No blacksmith in the entire Caribbean could repair it, I'm afraid.",
"There's only one quality that's good enough for me - excellent. Take your ",
