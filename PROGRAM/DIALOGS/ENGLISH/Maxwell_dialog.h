"Sir, don't you remember me?",
"Umm...to be honest, no.",
"I'm a sailor from Nigel Blythe's ship. He mutinied and sailed here for his old crew. The idea of serving under him didn't quite appeal to me, so I've gone ashore.",
"Such luck! Is Nigel still here?",
"No, he's already left. About five or six hours ago.",
"Damn!",
"Maybe his ex-boatswain Clauss knows where he went. They didn't get along, and now Clauss got himself up to his ears in debt and is working for the store owner.",
"Great news! You know my ship. I'll order them to enter you in the lists. I can always use a good seaman.",
"Oh, thank you, thank you, sir!",
"You're welcome.",
