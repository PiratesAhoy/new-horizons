". Do you need my shipyard's services, ",
"?",
"As a matter of fact, I do need you to patch up a couple of shell-holes and mend some sails.",
"Right now, I just need to talk to you.",
"No, I just thought I'd stop by.",
"Well, I'm very pleased to meet you. If you are a captain, then my shipyard is always at your service.",
"Perfect, ",
". Let's get started on those repairs.",
"Thanks. But first, let's talk.",
"Next time, perhaps. I've got to be on my way.",
"What exactly are you interested in, ",
"?",
"No, I don't believe I do.",
"I see. Do you need anything else, ",
"?",
"I'd like to put a couple of patches on the old wash-tub that brought me here!",
"That's all, thanks. Farewell!",
"What exactly do you need?",
"I need to repair my ship - although I might consider just scrapping it and buying a new one.",
"I need to install new guns on my ship.",
"Nothing, thanks.",
"I refuse to trade with a person of your reputation and relations. Now get out, ",
", before I call the guards.",
"Very well.",
"Allright, my dock beside the fort is available for you. If you want I'll tell my dockmaster to tow your ship in there. Only then can I survey the damage and tell you how much time and money it'll take. ",
"DOCK BESIDE THE FORT?? Uhh... I just remember that I have... eeh... another pressing business I must attend to first. Goodbye.",
