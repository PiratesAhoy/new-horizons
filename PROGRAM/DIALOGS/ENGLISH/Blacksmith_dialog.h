"Hello captain, pleased to meet you. I'm #sfullname#, the local blacksmith.",
"A blacksmith eh? So what exactly is it that you do? Can you repair anything for me?",
"Ah yes, of course I can, #ssir#! I can repair any sword you bring to me. Just equip the sword that needs fixing, and I'll fix it for you. The price varies for each type of sword and level of damage, but I can fix every sword in one day.",
"Good, let's get down to business!",
"Thanks, I'll keep it in mind! Goodbye.",
"Wow, your ",
" is in terrible condition! I HAVE to fix it!",
"Hmm, your ",
" is in pretty bad shape. Do you want me to fix it?",
"Well, your ",
" is in reasonable condition, but you could do so much more damage with it after I fix it!",
"Nice ",
"! I'd say sharpen it a little more, polish her up... What do you say?",
"Ha! And what exactly would you like me to do with your ",
"? Just kidding, I can polish her up for you if you like.",
"... That ",
" is amazing! A true masterpiece! I wouldn't dare do anything to it fearing I'd destroy it!",

"Very well...",
"Never mind. This might be a bit too expensive for my pocket.",
"There you go, I'm all done. I hope to see you again when you need my services.",
"Thanks, I'll know where to find you!",
"If you want my services, kindly equip a blade, a proper blade, before you talk to me.",
"Let me see what you have in stock.",
" pieces of gold.",
"I brought with me quite a lot of blades. Would you be able to put them all in a better condition?",
"Do I look like a multi-armed Indian god? I don't waste my time repairing your crew's forks and clubs so they can break them on someone's head again. But my apprentices could help you out.",
"Please have them repair the most damaged blades, so each is at least of average quality. Take these ",
"If they could bring the blades up to good quality, I'd pay you ",
"I hope your apprentices know their trade. I'll only accept fine quality. Here's your ",
"I'm not quite sure what blades you are talking about.",
"Sorry, never mind.",
"What exactly do you want me to do with that rusty antiquity!?!? No blacksmith in the entire Caribbean could repair it, I'm afraid.",
"There's only one quality that's good enough for me - excellent. Take your ",
