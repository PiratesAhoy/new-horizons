", dear visitor! I'm ",
", owner of the local shipyard.",
"And I'm ",
", captain of the ship '",
".'",
", ",
". Do you need my shipyard's services, ",
"?",
"As a matter of fact, I do need you to patch up a couple of shell-holes and mend some sails.",
"Right now, I just need to talk to you.",
"No, I just thought I'd stop by.",
"Well, I'm very pleased to meet you. If you are a captain, then my shipyard is always at your service.",
"Perfect, ",
". Let's get started on those repairs.",
"Thanks. But first, let's talk.",
"Next time, perhaps. I've got to be on my way.",
"What exactly are you interested in, ",
"?",
"No, I don't believe I do.",
"I see. Do you need anything else, ",
"?",
"I'd like to put a couple of patches on the old wash-tub that brought me here!",
"That's all, thanks. Farewell!",
"What exactly do you need?",
"I need to repair my ship - although I might consider just scrapping it and buying a new one.",
"I need to install new guns on my ship.",
"Nothing, thanks.",
"How can I help you, captain?",
".",
"I need to talk with Florens Clauss.",
"How can I help you, sir?",
"I need to talk with Florens Clauss.",
"Clauss? He owes me 5000 gold. If you're willing to pay off his debt, you can talk with him as much as you like.",
"Fine. I'll cover his debt.",
"I'm afraid I don't have that kind of money.",
"You're too late. Clauss's debt was paid by one of the local pirates who lives near the city. I'd advise you not to seek them out - they don't care for strangers.",
"So the pirates have Clauss now. I see....",
"Do you need my shipyard's services?",
"Nice to meet you.",
"Do you need my shipyard's services?",
"Perfect, ",
". Let's get started on that repair.",
"Thanks. But first, let's talk.",
"I have changed my mind. I'll give you 5000 gold to pay Clauss's debt.",
"Maybe next time. I've got to go.",
"I refuse to trade with a person of your reputation and relations. Now get out, ",
", before I call the guards.",
"Very well.",
"Allright, my dock beside the fort is available for you. If you want I'll tell my dockmaster to tow your ship in there. Only then can I survey the damage and tell you how much time and money it'll take. ",
"DOCK BESIDE THE FORT?? Uhh... I just remember that I have... eeh... another pressing business I must attend to first. Goodbye.",
"After closing this dialog, press ENTER to bring up the sail changing interface.",
"Exit",
"I would like to improve my ship, by chance.",
"Sire, you look nervous... by chance you haven't enough money right now?",
"- The last scientific improvement for your ship, directly from the Brest shipbuilders: copper plates to protect your hull from seaweed and other nuisances",
"- For such a famous captain, the best bronze cannons... Yes, they can be a little bit expensive, but they are the most accurate in the Caribbean",
"- What about those two wonderful long bronze chasers? They can bring down a mizzen mast from incredible distances",
"- Of course, Sir, we can provide you with new ropes, sails, cables, and all the rigging you need",
"- We have long top-masts, from the best 'palosanto' wood. You can get a couple more knots. But be aware to fix them well.",
"- I wouldn't dare to show this if you haven't such a fame of 'open-minded' and scientific sailor: the last published paper from the Royal Society of London show that with these triangular sails between your masts you can gain speed, turn, and even tack closer the wind.",
"- So do you want a stronger hull? We can reinforce the frames, beams and knees, but, beware, we can't TAKE THEM OUT afterwards.",
"- Yeah, I know, everybody wants to 'flush' a captured ship... of course, I'm not saying that you, sir, were a pirate! .",
"I would like to TAKE OUT an improvement",
"I've changed my mind, let's change the subject",
"Well, Sir, which of your ships will be the target?",
" (",
" piastras - ",
" days)",
"Well sire, our shipyard proudly offers these technical improvements...",
"- Ehum... maybe I should have to reconsider my decisions. Have a good day, Sir",
"- What do you want to scrap?",
"- I want to take out my copper plates",
"- I want to sell my bronze cannons",
"- These bronze chasers were a gift from a traders guild, but I have to sell them",
"- My brand new sails and Manila ropes",
"- I've tried using long top masts, but my ships behaves strange with them on top. I want to change to more common ones",
"- Ehum...stay sails! Buf! those strange inventions are never for good",
