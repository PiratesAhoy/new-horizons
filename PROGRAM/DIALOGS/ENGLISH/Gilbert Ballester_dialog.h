"Ah! You must be the inquisitor. My requests finally produced results!",
"Let's review a few details. As I understand it, you claim the priest leads a life of gluttony and depravity.",
"Yes, and I don't make such an accusation lightly. I have proof. ",
"What kind of proof?",
"I have in my possession love letters he wrote to a certain young lady.",
"Shocking! May I borrow them?",
"Of course. Here they are.",
"You'll pardon me, but I have to ask: How did you get them?",
"The young lady gave them to me in the hope that I could help her put an end to the father's unwanted attentions.",
"I see. I'll have to speak with her, of course, to confirm the truth of your accusations. Can you tell me her name and where I can find her?",
"Certainly. Her name is ",

". She works in the tavern.",
"This is all very interesting. But I feel it's only fair to tell you that I've already determined the father is innocent and has been falsely accused.",
"Thanks for your help.",
"Innocent? Who are you going to believe? These locals, who got the father's story while he was drunk as a skunk - or I, who give you proof you can hold in your hands?",
"I haven't decided yet. But I'll investigate your story - and you may rest assured that the guilty parties in this matter will be punished.",
