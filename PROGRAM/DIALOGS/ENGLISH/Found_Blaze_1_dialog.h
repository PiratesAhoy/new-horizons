"Captain! Is it really you?",
"It's me, friend! In the flesh.",
"It's a miracle! How did you manage to save yourself?",
"Settle down! I asked you a question.",
"Apologies, captain. We're just glad to see you safe and sound.",
"And I'm glad to be seen. But the question remains: What brought you here?",
"Well, after you were washed overboard, we were tossed by the storm for several more hours. When the tempest finally subsided, we found that the closest dry land was #sisland_Isla Muelle#. The ship was badly damaged, so we enlisted the services of the Spanish shipyard there. \nIt took quite a long time, but now '",
"ship storage",
"' is in very good shape.",
"That's good news. But how did you pay for the repairs?",
"We pooled our gold. Some of us were less happy to contribute than others...but their cuts and bruises will heal. After all, it's our ship, too -- although the crew will be pleased to know our captain is back!",
"Well, I'm grateful to all of you.",
"This calls for a celebration! Why don't we find our way to the tavern?",
"Better yet, let's have the tavern brought to the men. I'll have ten barrels of rum sent to the ship. Let them drink to my gratitude!",
"Hurrah to the captain! God bless you, ",
"!",
"I thank you all.",
"It really is a miracle you survived! God must with you, captain!",
"I'd like to think so, although at times I wonder...",
"...or the sea devil! I've heard he looks favorably on bold sailors and he keeps them safe from harm!",
"I don't believe I've heard that tale before.",
"What tale? Jovannie Speckled from the brig 'Ardent' told me he saw the sea devil himself!",
"Saw the devil? Through the bottom of a bottle of rum, I'll wager.",
"No, captain. He swore he hadn't touched a drop.",
"Wait for me here, men!",
"No, captain! Take me with you! You shouldn't walk onto the lion's den alone!",
"I'm not a little girl who needs a chaperone, my friend.",
"Of course not, captain. But...we've just gotten you back from the dead! Do it for my peace of mind.",
"No, no. A large company would only attract trouble.",
"But what will we do while you're gone?",
"You'll enjoy the rum. Oh, and have some sailors wait for me near the exit from #sOxbay#.",
"You think you might have to rush out of town?",
"I hope not. But you never know!",
"Is there no way I can change your mind, cap'n? Two strong fellows could easily help you deal with any trouble they might attract.",
"Then let them help guard the ship. I'll be back before you know I'm gone.",
"All right. We'll wait for you here, captain! If something goes wrong, just make your best speed back here. We'll cover you!",
"I believe it. But don't show yourself before then!",
"We'll take him to the ship, captain. I'm glad everything has ended so well.",
"Has it? Go, now. I'll follow you soon!",
