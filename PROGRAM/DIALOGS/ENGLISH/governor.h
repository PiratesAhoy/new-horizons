"I'd like to talk to you about a small piece of business.",
"I'm just here to pay my respects, #saddr#. Nothing more.",
"In that case, please leave my study and let me get back to more important matters.",
"Yes, of course. Sorry I disturbed you.",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have anything to talk about right now",
"Oh yes? There are some hostiles in our waters.",
"Those hostiles sound interesting.",

"Tough.",

"I must manage this colony.",
"Do you need any assistance, #saddr2#?",
"There are things I have to do.",
"You shall receive 50 percent of the value of any ship you sell as your share of the prize money. Additionally, there is a fixed price for any legit prize ship sold by those in my service.",
"Sounds profitable! And no haggling over prices will certainly be welcome, ",
"Thank you, ",

"I promise I will study this carefully.",

"I've got a problem with smugglers.",
"I would like to hear about the smugglers.",
"Lately more and more smugglers are appearing here. I want to ask you to investigate this. You will be provided with a suitable cargo. Please infiltrate their ranks and report your findings to me. As a reward for anything you report, you will receive a portion of the money which the smugglers pay for that cargo.",
"This sounds like a job for me!",
"I don't think this is a good job for me.",
"Very well. You will be given #samount# #scargo#. Be warned - do not try to abscond with either the cargo or the money from the smugglers! In addition, I will give you a document which shows you are in my service. This might help you in some cases. But beware the smugglers don't see it. If they do, I will deny everything.",
"Thank you, #saddr#!",
"I've got something you'll want to see.",
"This is very interesting, you did a very good job.",
" As a reward I will pay you ",
" But I think you've only barely scratched the surface, so please go on and try to find out more!",
"Good job! We hoped there was a list like this but we could never find it!",
"Ah! So this is how they do it! Thank you for the information.",
"Have you had any time to look at the reports I made?",
"As a matter of fact, I did. And I think you've provided us with all the information we needed. Maybe we need more information later. But for now this will do. As a token of gratitude, please accept this little gift.",
"Okay #saddr#, when you need me again, please let me know.",
"It seems some of your fort commanders fire at me on sight, even though I am no enemy.",

"You could prove your loyalty to #sgov_nation# through your assistance.",
"It seems I have misplaced my ship, #saddr#. But I cannot do much damage to our enemies without one.",
"This is no laughing matter! You are lucky that we need all available captains. I shall give you a new command rather than drag you in front of a court martial, but don't expect a promotion any time soon!",
"I will not let you down, #saddr#. That I promise!",
"You are a disgrace to my great nation! You are hereby dishonourably discharged from the service. Get out of my sight!",
"I should have seen that one coming, I suppose. We may meet again in the future, though that will likely be under different circumstances. And you may not like it!",
"By the way, I'll need you to return that document I gave you. It won't be valid any more.",
"Of course, #saddr#.",
"Now, go to #sGreenford# Naval HQ, if you please. #sbriefing_officer# awaits you there with your new orders, I believe.",
"Very good, #saddr#. I shall sail for #sGreenford# at once.",
"What are other pirates saying about me these days?",
"They've heard of your recent exploits! They're calling you ",
"Your raiding has not gone unnoticed among the Brethren of the Coast. They've taken to referring to you as ",
"That last bit of plundering was the talk of the tavern for days! You're being called ",
"Normally that would be true. Your exploits should have earned you a promotion.\nHowever, word has reached me that you have been executing prisoners of war. This is in violation of the regulations which you are required to follow.\nWorse, if our enemies should learn of it, they may in reprisal execute our men who are their prisoners.\nAs you may not have known this, I am inclined to leniency this one time. Your promotion is blocked but no further action will be taken.",
"Thank you for your mercy, Excellency.",
"Be warned, though. You no longer have the excuse of ignorance. Should I learn of further executions on your part, you will be dismissed from our service.",
"\nMoreover, I understand that you have Letters of Marque from other nations. I shall be writing to their ambassadors to inform them of all this. Their governors will also not take kindly to the execution of prisoners of war.",
"I understand, Excellency. Goodbye.",
"You would need to make contact with the local smugglers, for which purpose I would provide you with a suitable cargo. Unfortunately your ship lacks the space for that cargo.",
"Very well, I shall return when I have more room in my hold.",
"I wish to report that I arrested the smugglers myself. You can read the full details in my report.",
"Very good, #saddr#!",
" Now, about the #samount# #scargo# which you were given. That is the property of the state and should be returned. ",
"It is being unloaded from your ship now.",
"Fair enough.",
"You no longer seem to have it. You have one month in which to recover it. If you fail to do so, I shall assume that you have stolen the cargo and you will be declared an outlaw.",
"Don't worry, I'll get your cargo back for you, one way or another!",
" Now, you received the sum of #smoney# from the smugglers in exchange for the cargo provided to you by the state, so that money also belongs to the state. Please return it.",
"Next, you received the sum of #smoney# from the smugglers in exchange for the cargo provided to you by the state, so that money also belongs to the state. Please return it.",
"Certainly, Excellency.",
"Umm... I don't have that much now.",
"Indeed. Then you have one month in which to raise #smoney# and return here. If you fail to do so, I shall assume that you have stolen the money and you will be declared an outlaw.",
"Then I had better leave at once to recover your money!",
"And now for your reward. ",
"For making contact with the smugglers and reporting on their activities, you will receive ",
"For arresting the smugglers yourself, you will receive ",
" percent of the value of the cargo. That amounts to ",
" gold.",
"a basic payment of ",
" gold as the cargo was not worth much.",
"Are you ready to replace the #samount# #scargo# which was provided for your smuggling mission?",
"Yes, I have your cargo.",
"No, I have not yet been able to replace it.",
"That is good. The cargo will now be unloaded from your ship. ",
" Now, get out of my sight!",
"Have you the #smoney# which you owe from your smuggling mission?",
"Yes, I have enough to repay you.",
"No, I still do not have enough to repay you.",
"Very well. Then there will be no further punishment, but this will go on your record.",
" Now, leave!",
"Then leave, and do not return until you have what you owe me. Remember that my patience is limited!",
"Goodbye, #saddr#.",
" In addition, ",
"I have a special mission for someone with your particular talents.",
"A special mission? That sounds intriguing.",
"You are to investigate the '",
"', a ",
" in the port of ",
" on ",
".",
"Do you want me to sabotage the '",
"'?",
"No. This ship is of little importance itself, but we believe she will join a larger force somewhere else. Your mission is to find that larger force, then report back here.\nIt would also be helpful if you can find out the enemy's plans for that larger force.",
"I understand. I'll sail for ",
" as soon as I can. Goodbye, Excellency.",
"That sounds a bit too complicated for me, Excellency. Perhaps when I have more experience I shall feel worthy of such a mission. Until then, goodbye.",
"Ah, you have returned. Have you completed your mission?",
"Yes, Excellency. I managed to get aboard the '",
"', which sailed from ",
" to ",
". There I was able to break into the town hall, where I found the enemy's plans. Here is a copy I made. I left the original where it was so that the enemy does not know that I found it.",
"Very wise! You have done an excellent job. ",
"Now that we know what the ",
" fleet intends to do, we can send our own ships to prepare a surprise for them. Here is your payment.",
"As you may know, while you have been away, ",
" and ",
" have signed a peace treaty. But the plans which you brought back show that ",
" probably intends to break the treaty. When they do, we shall be ready for them. Here is your payment.",
"There is one thing more, Excellency. I had to hire a ship to bring me back here. I didn't have enough money to pay the captain, so I promised double the fare when I arrived here. Can I claim the fare as expenses?",
"How much expense do you mean?",
"I owe ",
" gold, Excellency.",
"You have already been paid ",
", and now you want more! But I am not unreasonable. You should not be left out of pocket after such a service.\nVery well, you can have an extra ",
". That, plus what you have already been paid, will cover your debt and still leave you with a reward.",
"Thank you, your Excellency.",
