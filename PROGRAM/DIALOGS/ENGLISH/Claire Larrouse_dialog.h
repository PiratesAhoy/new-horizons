"Why, you seem to have quite a fleet. Tis a shame there's no room for lil ole me, now isn't it?",
"Hello, #sfriend#! Are you a captain, perchance?",
"Yes, I am. Why do you ask?",
"Pecker off, you inexperienced welp. I have no use for you.",
"All right. I'll come back later.",
"This might just be a lucky day for both of us. I'm preparing to undertake a rather risky venture, and I have a feeling you would be an excellent partner.",
"How risky?",
"Let's just say the profit would be worth the danger. How would you like to lay your hands on a veritable mound of gold?",
"Is that a trick question? Keep talking.",
"I get about all the risk I can stand without looking for more. Sorry.",
"Ha! I knew you were the #sgender# for the job. Listen: All we need to do is land at a secure place and take the gold. A brilliant plan!",
"Sounds like you skimmed over two very important points. First: land where? Second: take the gold from whom?",
"Those details are all worked out, I assure you. But I can't reveal the rest of the plan until I'm sure we're partners. Once we're under way together, I'll tell all!",
"I suppose I have nothing to lose. When can you be ready to set sail?",
"Sorry. I don't have time to waste on a wild goose chase.",
"The sooner the better! My ship is already waiting for me at the port. Join me and we'll head to #sisland_Oxbay#.",
"Fine. I'll wrap up my business here and join you. By the way, what are your terms?",
"The usual - we'll split the loot evenly between our crews.",
"Fair enough. All right, I'll meet you at the port.",
"Half of our work is already done, my friend! All we have to do now is capture the mines, and the gold will be ours.",
"English gold? You didn't say it was English gold.",
"So?",
"Never mind.",
"No, no. I understand - I don't want trouble with the English, either. But if we follow my plan to the letter, no one will ever know we were here.",
"Wait. You're saying we should just kill them all? That's your 'brilliant plan'?",
"Exactly!",
"I should've known. Look, just take it easy, and maybe we won't have to shed any blood.",
"That was one mighty commotion, my friend!",
"True enough. But I don't see any gold.",
"You're right. Blast! They've already shipped it away. Hurry - the cart tracks are still fresh. We can still catch up with them. I'm sure they're taking the gold to #sOxbay#, as always.",
"I suppose we've gone too far to turn back now. Let's get after them!",
"No! I've had enough of this foolishness! I'm sorry I ever got mixed up in your crazy scheme.",
"If we capture this convoy, I'll personally donate a giant golden cross to the church!",
"Stop chattering! They're not going to wait for us.",
"No! We're partners. You'll help me see this through, or I'll run you through!",
"Try it. We'll see if you have any fight left in you!",
"All right, all right. I don't have the stomach for more fighting just yet.",
"There they are! We mustn't let them slip away!",
"Onward!",
"Blast! We lost them! Damn your incompetence, now we'll have to leave with nothing.",
"And leave fast, before they decide to turn and chase us! I guess this dissolves our partnership.",
"We did it!",
"Yes, but now we've got to get out of here - and we'll never fight our way back to the ships.",
"Too true. We need a plan. We can't let this gold slip through our fingers.",
"How about this: We send a couple of men to the ships. They can guide them to a nearby bay.",
"Good, good. That's what we'll do. Now let's get out of here, quick!",
"...",
"We're in the right place and our ships are here. All we have to do is load the gold. It'll take a while so we'll have to wait.",
"Quiet. I hear voices. Sounds like we're about to have company!",
"Whew! This has been one wild day. Finally we can load the gold and make good our escape.",
"Right. Half for you and half for me, just as we agreed.",
"I think not. This venture was a lot riskier than you led me to believe. So I'm going to need a bigger share of the profit.",
"Not exactly. You nearly got me killed with your 'brilliant plan'. I'll be taking all of the gold.",
"Excellent! You're a #sgender# of your word. The gold we captured is worth ",
" in coin. So your share comes to ",
".",
"Not bad for a day's work.",
"Not bad at all. What say we continue this partnership and sail together?",
"Sounds good to me.",
"I don't think that's such a good idea.",
"I'm pleased to hear it.",
"Welcome to the crew then, ",
". Now let's get back to our ships.",
"I'll be headed back to #sIsla Muelle#, then. You can find me there if you need.",
"Very well.",
"Still considering my offer?",
"Yes, I haven't forgotten it.",
"No, I've already decided. Welcome to my crew.",
"Excellent! There's no limit to what you and I can achieve together!",
"Yes, yes. But for now, we've got plenty of business to take care of.",
"What?! You'll take half and like it, or I'll cut you down right here!",
"Relax. I was...kidding. Half is plenty for me.",
"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. I need a bigger share!",
"Over my dead body!",
"I couldn't have said it better myself! En garde!",
"You look familiar, in a mirror sort of way! Are you a captain like myself, perchance?",
"You have no right to wear that face! Get lost before I remove it from you!",
