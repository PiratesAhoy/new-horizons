"Oui, #ssir#?",
"Are you Octave Fabre?",
"I am indeed.",
"I have a question to ask of you. It is said you know a lot about this archipelago.",
"That is true. I spent most my life sailing the seven seas and I gained a lot of knowledge that way. Even concerning some, shall we say, more mysterious aspects of the sea.",
"Excellent. That's exactly what I need! A fisherman at #sPhilipsburg# claims to have seen a ship being attacked by a giant... octopus.",
"A giant octopus, you say? Was this during a storm, by chance? And afterwards a mysterious pirate ship seemed to emerge from the sea itself?",
"Yes, yes! How did you know?",
"Stories of this mythical sea monster have always been told amongst sailors. I was young and foolish and I did not believe them. Until one day we were caught up in a storm just like that.",
"Yet you... sit here alive? What happened?",
"We were lucky. The Kraken was after another ship and we just happened to be close by. We changed our heading away from the scene as quickly as we could. After that, I spent most of my life trying to find out what it was I had seen.",
"So what did you find out?",
"This giant octopus is said to be the pet of a man called Davy Jones. I should not really call him a man though. All accounts I have heard describe him as being as ruthless as his monster with a face too horrible to describe.",
"So it is he who is behind all these events? Then it is he who I must try to find.",
"Know what you are getting into. This is not something to be taken lightly. If Davy Jones decides to kill you, there is no way you can escape.",
"Thanks for the warning. I'll be careful.",
"(There are some debris and a small chest in the sand next to the body)",
"Let's have a look what's in this chest.",
"(There are some papers inside)",
