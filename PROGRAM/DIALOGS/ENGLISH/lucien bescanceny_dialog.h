"Hey, ",
", you drunkard! Get up! We need to talk!",
"How is it even possible to get this drunk? Do you have a hollow leg?",
"...hic...snore...",
", get up, I said! I'm here on business from Geronimo!",
"Geronimo? Why didn't you say that instead of trying to cave in my ribs with your boot?",
"Yeah, yeah - why don't you have another drink? Maybe you'll forget I kicked you. Now get up and let's talk.",
"Talk about what? I'm not supposed to meet with Geronimo until tomorrow. That was the deal. ",
"Man, you really are drunk, aren't you? Can you even remember your own name?",
"Look, there's nothing wrong with my memory. We're supposed to meet tomorrow. He'll give us the rest of the money, and we'll give him those statuettes we stole from the trader's warehouse.",
"Very impressive - except for one little detail. There's been a change of plans. The meeting is today.",
"Listen, ",
". You've just confessed to everything. Now let's see if we can't come to a friendly agreement...",
"If he wants to meet today, why doesn't he just come tell me himself?",
"You don't understand anything, do you, drunkard? Everyone in the city is talking about the theft. Geronimo wants to keep a low profile.",
"He's afraid, is he? I knew he was a coward when I met him!",
"I don't care what you think about him, and I'm certain he doesn't. Now get up, and let's go.",
"Where?",
"Where do you think? To the place where you hid those statuettes! I'm assuming even you aren't fool enough to keep them here.",
"Uh...actually...in fact...I did keep them here.",
"Brilliant. Well, at least we don't need to go anywhere for them.",
"Listen, ",
". You've just confessed to everything. Now let's see if we can't come to a friendly agreement...",
"Wait a second! What about Geronimo?",
"To tell you the truth, I don't know any Geronimo. Give me the statuettes immediately.",
"You want to fight, do you? Fine.",
"What do you mean?",
"Give me the statuettes, or I'll drag you to the first guard I can find and tell him what you've just told me - and you'll have to give them back to the man you stole them from. Either way, you lose the statuettes. My way, you don't go to jail.",
"Maybe I'll just kill you and find the statuettes myself.",
"Ah, you rat!",
"Do you have some sort of a death wish?!",
"Can you guarantee I'll go free? ",
"I give you my word.",
"All right. I'm going to trust you. I'll tell you everything.",
"It's a deal.",
"Your word?! You just lied to me! Now you're blackmailing me! And you want me to take your word?",
"Well, I could always cut you down where you stand.",
"Geronimo hired me to steal those statuettes for him. Promised me 5,000 gold for the job. I'm supposed to meet up with him tomorrow outside the city.",
"Perfect! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just going to find a guard so you can tell him what you've just told me. If you value your life, you'll hold very still while I tie you up.",
