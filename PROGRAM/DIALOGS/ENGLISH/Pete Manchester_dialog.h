"It's nice to see a person in this god-forsaken hole who dresses nice. My name is ",
", and I am the owner of this establishment.",
"You talk about how I'm dressed but you can't even keep this pigsty clean? Well, I see what a good tavern-keeper you are.",
"Of course, as you say, ",
". How can I help you?",
"I need to hire some sailors for my crew.",
"My crew is worn out from battle and I want to hire some young, inexperienced sailors who are looking for a job.",
"I have a business proposition for you.",
"Do you have a free room? I'd like to stay here for some time.",
"Do you have a free room in this pigsty?",
"I don't have any more questions for you. Bye bye.",
"I found out everything I wanted to know. Farewell.",
"Then let's talk business. So, what do you want?",
"Thanks, no. I need Rheims' navigator.",
"I am looking for one person. It's a girl whose name is ",
"Danielle",
"Danielle",
", maybe you know something about her?",
"I'd like to confess my sins but they say the local priest is buried in sins himself. Is that true?",
"You know, it looks like you were wrong about the priest.",
"That Dutchman was just crazy, so I had to kill him. Did you find anything out from the waitress?",
"That Dutchman refused to talk to me. Maybe you've managed to learn something from your servants?",
"I found out that those letters are really fake. What did you figure out?",
"I'd like to know the details about the death of the person named ",
"Giraldo Figuiera",
"Giraldo Figuiera",
".",
"I'd like to know if a black frigate arrived in the port.",
"Tell me, has a man named ",
"Blaze",
"Blaze",
" shown up lately? He's a captain. It's hard to miss him.",
"I need to leave the town, discreetly. Maybe you can help me do it? For, say, 1 gold piece?",
"I need information about a certain man. He's always wearing a red robe and calls himself 'Teacher.'",
"I need some work. Don't you know any rich boys on this island who are afraid to travel alone?",
"Nothing at the moment.",
"If there is such a person, he might prefer to avoid attracting attention with so many consorts -- as I'd expect you to know.", 
"Yes, I forgot. All right, I'll come back later, when I've got fewer ships, ha ha.",
"I don't want to help you. You've done too much harm to my country already",
"Just look at this patriot. Well, goodbye",
"Your head's covered in blood. You don't seriously think that somebody would travel with you?",
"You're right -- everybody's afraid of me! Ha ha!",
"You came just in time. One merchant here was searching for the right company to travel with. You'd better talk to him. Here he is, coming into the tavern.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is nobody for that moment, Maybe next time.",
"Hm, than I will wait.",
"Ah! You'll have to go to the warden of the prison! This lad got arrested a few days ago -- he was inciting people to rebel.",
"Oh, good, you've helped me a lot.",
"By the way, some navigator lives not far from here. Maybe he's the one you're looking for?",
"Thanks! I think I'll pay him a visit...",
"I don't think so. But if you pay me 50 gold coins...",
"Deal. Here are your coins.",
"This is plain robbery!",
"Let's go to the back room, I'll give you a new set of clothes so you don't get recognized.",
"Great!",
"Not recently. He usually shows up here from time to time, but it's been a long since I've last seen him.\n They say he sank with his ship during that storm a week ago.",
"I've heard that...",
"A black frigate? Let me think.... No, I am sure that there was no black frigate at our port. \nI know one fellow though, who has seen it before.",
"And? How can I find that person?",
"There he is at the nearest table. If I am not mistaken his name is ",
"Balltesar Figueiredo",
"Balltesar Figueiredo",
".",
"Good, I'll go and talk to him.",
"Yes, that woman confessed that no one has ever written such letters to her and she told all those lies by order of the priest's assistant.",
"Excellent, thank you. Your help has been invaluable.", // --Cat
"You are wrong! That person is innocent and all those rumors are unfounded.",
"Well, how did those letters appear, then?",
"I think they're fake. I saw the priest's assistant recently talking with a Dutchman named ",
"Yedam Kinne",
"Yedam Kinne",
"\n Everyone knows that besides the many other dubious things that fellow can do, he can also fake documents and handwriting.",
"Hmm...Good, I'll try to find out the details. In the meantime you should talk with the waitress. Maybe she will tell you something important too.",
"Oh! You came to the right person. That accident has been discussed by many people several nights in a row at my place.",
"Then what do you know about the person who killed him?",
"They say that it was some crazy girl who did that. He was either her lover or her ponce. \nThey say she is a beautiful girl and very smart. She even managed to escape from the prison! Can you imagine that? \nDo you know why she killed him? A gold statuette was found in the house of the murdered fellow and it's weight was about 10 pounds! \nIt would be interesting to know where that guy took that statuette from, eh!",
"Yeh, on the one hand he got lucky to have such a good thing but on the other hand if it wasn't for that statuette he would have been alive. Where is it now? Is it possible to have a look at that miracle?",
"Ha! Are you trying to plan how to get hold of it? \nYou'll not be able to do that! The idol is with the head of the garrison and he won't give it to anyone. \nThere were 3 fellows who tried to mess with him...their heads are still hanging on the city's gates.",
"So, you say that the idol is with the head of the garrison? That's good.",
"Are you talking about ",
"Father Jerald",
"Father Jerald",
"? Don't listen to those wicked lies, ",
"! \nYes, sometimes he can drink a glass or two of wine but he is and he always was a very devout man. \nI believe that you should not be afraid at all of going to him for the confession.",
"Oh! Thank you for removing all my doubts about him.",
"Yes, I've heard about her.",
"Yes, really?! What exactly have you heard about her? When did she come here last time?",
"You give me one gold piece, ",
", and I'll tell you everything I know.",
"Take this coin.",
"Ha! For such money I'd tell you anything myself.",
"She was here not long before the liberation of #sOxbay# but she didn't stay here. I remember her because some worker tried to proposition her, but she put him in his place.",
"Huh, you don't know much. Tell me please, have you heard anything about the earthen tablets that were found in the mines?",
"Pay me one more gold piece, ",
" and I'll tell you. ",
"Skinflint! Here it is, take it.",
"Eh, no, I'll try to find something out myself then.",
"Earthen tablets you say? Yes, I know about them. There was a fellow who lived at my place several years ago and he took a lot of trouble over those tablets. They didn't let him take them with him from the mines, so he worked right there and he used to say that the tablets would make him rich and famous.",
"I see. So where is he now?",
"God only knows. I am telling you that they didn't let him take those tablets from the mines, although I don't understand why. So, that fellow ran out of money and moved out of here and since then I've never seen him again.",
"All right, I guess I'll have to go to the mines. Where is that place?",
"You should go outside the town and then you'll see the mines. There is a lighthouse behind them. I am sure you'll easily find them.",
"Good.",
"Usually I've got a lot of men in here that would like to become seaman, but it's too late now. They'll start showing up only in the morning\nWhy don't you rent a room and wait for them?",
"Very well. Do you have any free rooms?",
"I don't need a room right now. Let's change the subject.",
"I've got rooms available. How long are you going to stay here for?",
"Till the morning.",
"Till night.",
"It'll cost you 5 gold pieces.",
"Here is your money.",
"Alas, it looks like such a luxury as sleeping in a bed is not for me and my wallet. I'll sleep in the tavern hall.",
"Do you have a king-size room for rent? No, thanks...for this price I'll sleep in the tavern hall.",
"I'll think about it.",
"It'll cost you 5 gold.",
"Here is your money.",

"Do you have a king size room for rent? No, thanks, for this price I'll sleep in the tavern-hall.",
"I'll think about it.",
"Dear visitors! Please, stop this outrage in my tavern or I'll call for the guards!",
"All right. I'm already leaving.",
"Remember when you told me to speak to the warden about a prisoner? Well, now I've went and killed the grimey bastard, so what should I do now?",
"Well, since the warden's dead, I say just go and talk to the prisoner. It's not like anyone's gonna stop you.",
"I'll do that. Thank you.",
"Ah! This lad got arrested a few days ago -- he was inciting people to rebel. Since the warden's been killed, I suggest you just go to the prison and have a chat with the bugger.",
