"So, why do you distract me from the very important affairs of state?",
"I'd like to talk to you about a small piece of business.",
"I'm just here to pay my respects, #saddr#. Nothing more.",
"In that case, please leave my study and let me get back to more important matters.",
"Yes, of course. Sorry I disturbed you.",
"I'm sorry, but I don't have anything to talk about right now",
"Oh yes? I have a proposition for you, captain.",
"Indeed?",
"I have learned that you completed the task successfully; my congratulations, captain! Here is your reward.",
"My thanks; It was a pleasure to aid you.",
"You must destroy the ",

"I crave forgiveness, your Excellency.",
"I'm interested to learn about #sgov_nation# relations with other nations.",
"I'm looking for a Letter of Marque.",

"Yes, I am.",

"Uh, never mind.",
"Very well. But I hope you will reconsider, in time...",
"Goodbye, ",
"Huh?",
"Tough.",
"Welcome to Cartagena, #ssir#. I'm Gregorio Montavez, the Governor of this town. It's a pleasure to see an high representative of the nobility here. Did you have a good journey?",
"Yes, thank you. As you know, I'm Dom Guillermo de la Rosa, Envoy of our King.",
"I knew it. Your arrival was expected...",
"I'm told Cartagena was the most beautiful city of the Caribbean and it's true. Just the port is impressive with this great fort guarding the entry.",
"It's San Felipe, Excellency. It can resist to any warships' attack.",
"I believe. I hope to visit it.",
"Of course, tomorrow, I'll show you the San Felipe fort if you accept.",
"Excellent, anyway, checking the defenses of Cartagena is one of the goals of my visit. Please, read this letter written by our King to understand better the purpose of my coming.",
"I see... I must give you all the details of the situation of Cartagena: forces and weaknesses and what's my strategy to develop the town. It's a long report you must prepare.",
"Don't worry; I'll have the necessary time for this work. I must stay here for two weeks before visiting the other Caribbean Spanish colonies.",
"Very well, but first let me prepare a party. Tonight, you'll be the honor house-guest of Cartagena. For the dinner, all the aristocracy of my town will be with you. And I didn't forget you'll have a bedroom in my residence, more comfortable than a ship cabin for your stay.",
"Thank you for such invitation, Governor.",
"Will you follow me so that I can show you a bit the town?", 
"I'd like but I cannot right now. I must talk to the Captain of my ship to give him some instructions for the stay.",
"I understand. Don't arrive too late to my residence tonight.",
"Of course, I don't want to miss my own party ha ha!",
"Dom Guillermo, come in! Let me introduce you some good people of Cartagena.",
"Of course, Governor.", 
"As I said, let me introduce you some people of my town. The first one is the Admiral of my town, Lorenzo Delgado.",
"I hope you like this party.",
"Obviously, Excellency. However, I wouldn't like to go and rest too late tonight.",
"That's understandable. As soon as you're tired, talk to my valet, he'll show you your bedroom.",
"Thank you so much.",
"Dom Guillermo de la Rosa! Did you rest enough last night?",
"Yes, Governor. The residence's bedroom is much better than a ship's cabin to sleep.",
"Ha! ha! I foretold it. So are you ready to visit Cartagena?",
"Absolutely. I'm above all impatient to visit the San Felipe fort.",
"The strongest fort of the Caribbean as you know. Let's start by the fort if you wish, Dom Guillermo...",
"As you can see, the fortress is located in a strategic location, dominating approaches to the city by land or sea.",
"Indeed, the location couldn't be better.",
"Even if the fortress is old seeing the construction began in the year 1536, a few years ago, it was expanded.",
"Could you explain me its architecture?",
"Of course, the fortification consists of a series of walls, wide at the base and narrow toward the parapet, forming a formidable pattern of bunkers. The batteries and parapets protect one another, so making it practically impossible to take a battery without taking the whole defence system. The guns of the castle command the whole bay, so that any suspicious vessel attempting to dock could be attacked.",
"Impressive...",
"The fortress is striking for its grand entrance and its complex maze of tunnels. In short, it is the most formidable defensive complex of Spanish military in the Caribbean.",
"What do you mean by the term complex maze of tunnels? Is there any difference with the other Spanish fortifications?",
"The number of tunnels is bigger than any other Spanish forts in the Caribbean. This allows to the soldiers to move quickly from one point to another and this is an advantage if the fort is under attack.",
"Certainly...",
"But the tunnels are not limited to the fortress.",
"I don't understand, Governor.", 
"There is even a tunnel connecting the fort to the city. Thus, the fortress can receive the garrisons of the town if under attack.",
"This increases drastically the number of soldiers that can defend the fortress...",
"Yes. That's why I consider San Felipe unassailable.",
"Humm... Just for curiosity where is the exit of the tunnel in the town?",
"Don't worry, it is in the Admiral's Office. The best protected location of the city HAHA!",
"Everything seems to be well-thought. Our King will be happy to know how the town is well-protected.",
"Thank you, Dom Guillermo. But follow me, there is still something I want to show you.",
"Here we are, at the top of the fort.",
"The view is fantastic on the bay.",
"Indeed. But follow me to this cabin just front of you. I think you'd like another view.",
"Look at this reserve of powder.",
"What impressive quantity of barrels you've got!",
"Barrels of powder and cannonballs. We could fight an armada of ships if necessary.",
"Certainly, Governor. I already thought San Felipe was an impressive fort but now I note its defences and its organization are the best I've ever seen. My visit in Cartagena isn't finished but I must say my first impressions are very good.",
"Thank you for these encouraging words, Dom Guillermo. But I see it's already noon, maybe you want to lunch with me in my residence before continuing your visit.",
"Thank you, Governor for your invitation but since yesterday afternoon I didn't see my crew and I must talk to them to know if everything is alright on my ship. So, I'll lunch with them on the ship.",
"As you like, I'll wait for you this afternoon in my residence so that we can continue the visit.",
"I'll be there at 2 o'clock.",
"Ah! Dom Guillermo,",
"Governor, I've just talked to your daughter in front of your residence and she told me you have a problem with the Dutch.",
"Unfortunately, yes. One of their warships attacked many Spanish trade ships these last months in the route between Cartagena and Puerto Rico. From one of our spies, I knew one hour ago that warship moors in Willemstad and she stays there one more week to be repaired and supplied. I decided to attack her with my own fleet over the next days.",
"So, I cannot continue the visit of the town with you this afternoon?",
"That's true, Dom Guillermo. I need many days to finish this operation and I will weigh anchor today. Do you want to accompany me during the mission.",
"Humm... I prefer to continue my duty here, Governor. I also have a mission to accomplish and I'm sure I could prepare my report talking to your subordinates.",
"Of course, Dom Guillermo. People of Cartagena will give you all the necessary help during my absence.",
"Thank you, Governor. Time has come to let you alone. You must prepare your leave and I don't want to delay that anymore.",
"Don't worry, in a few days, I'll be back bringing some good news.",
"Our king will appreciate your loyalty to Spain. Have a good journey.",
"Dom Guillermo ! I was about to send a man to your ship. I was in a hurry to talk to you.",
"It's about the mission? Did you succeed?",
"Well... Not really, unfortunately. The Dutch have repelled our raid. I've had the feeling they were waiting for us.",
"How is it possible?",
"I don't know. Willemstad was prepared for the attack and we didn't benefit of the surprise effect. Anyway, I will find another way to sink their fleet. But, it was not about the mission I wanted to see you.",
"No?",
"I learned you fought Dom Ortega.",
"It was just a disagreement.",
"You call disagreement a duel?! Dom Ortega is one of the most important persons of my town. Is it your way to thank my hospitality?",
"I'm sorry, Governor. This won't happen any more.",
"I hope so because otherwise I should report your behaviour to our King. Not sure, he appreciates. Anyway, there is another problem. I knew the reason of this duel. It seems you want to woo my daughter.",
"We have a lot of affinities...",
"And I can't accept this situation. I promised the daughter's hand to the Ortega's parents. I want to gather our families with the wedding.",
"Governor, your daughter doesn't love Dom Ortega.",
"It isn't your problem, Dom Guillermo. This is something I must solve between me and my daughter. With time, she will change her mind about Dom Ortega.",
"But...",
"Stop, Dom Guillermo. Our discussion about my daughter is over. Until your leave, my daughter will stay in the cloister of Cartagena and you are banned to see her again. Do we agree?",
"[THINKS: Dash it!] As you wish, Governor.",
"Excellent, I knew you were a reasonable #sgender#. Otherwise, do you still need my help for finishing your report?",
"I just need to see your Admiral.",
"Ah! He must already be in his office at this hour. The task was hard for him during the mission, but he's a brave man and does not let down even after a failure.",
"Good to hear. I'm going to his office right now. Have a good day, Governor.",
"Dom Guillermo! How do you do?",
"I'm fine, Governor Montavez. Just two days before my leave.",
"There is an end for everything.",
"Indeed. That's weird...",
"What is it weird?",
"One hour ago, I was talking to a guard and I knew a pirate was arrested in the Cloister. Pirate, Cloister... What is the link?",
"I confirm and we know his name. That's Johan Elting, a traitor. He was recognized by one of my captains leading a patrol at night. This captain worked many years in Havana before being transferred here.",
"A traitor??",
"Yes, he worked for Spain. In fact, for the former Vice-Admiral of #sHavana# before betraying and killing him.",
"That's horrible! We can't rely on any Dutch.",
"You're right. Unfortunately, the Vice-Admiral made this mistake. But, with me, he won't have any chances. He will be hanged soon.",
"Good. He must be locked in the jail.",
"No.",
"No??",
"He's locked of course but in a secret place. I wanted to be sure no crewmember or friend of him would try to free him before his death.",
"Good initiative. I didn't know you had another jail in the town...",
"It's a secret cave under the Church. Nobody could think of a such location there HAHA!!",
"HAHA! What ingeniousness! I recognize the Spanish spirit! So, he will be hanged today?",
"No, tomorrow. I want to know why he was in the cloister. I think he was trying to kidnap my daughter for a future ransom but I'm not completely sure. That's why, he'll be tortured to obtain an avowal.",
"[THINKS: Torture!?] It could be useless, a pirate like him must have a great will. He could resist at any kind of torture.",
"We'll see. But, don't waste much of your time and talk about the life of a pirate. Otherwise, do you still need my help before your leave?",
"Not particularly. I ordered to my crew to prepare the leave buying the necessary supplies and tomorrow afternoon this task will be accomplished.",
"And what will be your next mission?",
"I must visit Havana and Santiago de Cuba as I did here before returning to Spain.",
"Good. Could you present me before your leave the conclusions of your report about Cartagena, Dom Guillermo?",
"I'll do. I'll see you again tomorrow afternoon for the report. Have a good day, Governor.",
"Good afternoon, Dom Guillermo.",
"Good afternoon, Excellency. When I was crossing the town I noted there were more soldiers patrolling.",
"Indeed, an order of mine. Last night, the Dutch Elting was freed. We're trying to find him.",
"Unbelievable, how was that possible?",
"Someone helped him... The most curious is I DO not understand how he knew Elting was hidden in the Church.",
"Maybe, some of his men were spying in the town and have seen your soldiers taking him to the Church.",
"You must be right. I told them to take Elting discreetly but it seems there are still some incompetent people in my guard. I'll deal with them later.",
"Well, otherwise, I think you asked to present my report today.",
"You're right. You can start your speech.",
"Thank you, Dom Guillermo. From what you said, it seems you liked how the town is managed and protected.",
"Exactly. Our king will be pleased by my report about Cartagena. I hope to see the same level of exigency in Cuba.",
"I think so. I know the Governors of Santiago and Havana and they don't save efforts to protect their towns",
"That's perfect, Excellency. It's time to come back to my ship and confirm all the preparatives for my journey to Cuba are ready.",
"Of course, of course. Do that, tomorrow morning I'll be in the port to say goodbye.",
"Thank you, see you tomorrow.",
