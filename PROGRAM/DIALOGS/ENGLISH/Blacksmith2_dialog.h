"Yes? Don't just stand there; you need a blacksmith or not?",
"I might, but I see no reason for your unfriendly tone. Tell me of your services and I'll decide if they're worth your charming company.",
"You give me your equipped blade, I repair it to whatever quality you like. I'll charge you as I see fit, depending on the work. And you're going to have to wait a day; I'm a busy man. My name is Robierto Cabelodoferro, by the way, if you were expecting pleasantries.",
"All right, Robierto. If you're a worthy craftsman with my sword, I'll pay you what you're worth.",
"I can see you're occupied even now, much too busy to be bothered. I'll come again.",
"Hmph! I'm almost insulted, you bringing such a sorry-looking ",
" in here. I've never seen worse. All right, better let me have it.",
"Feh! Were I you, captain, I'd sooner throw away that miserable ",
" than sink a single coin into its repair. But it's your choice - and gold.",
"Ha! What an unremarkable ",
". I'd almost rather not waste my time on it, if not for the gold you're about to part with.",
"Meh. If you think I'm impressed with that little ",
" , captain, you're wrong. When I'm through with it, it'll be a finer blade than you deserve.",
"Har-de-har-har. You call that wretched ",
" of yours a sword? I'll show you a sword, when I'm through with it.",
"Bah! You bring me an already perfect",
"? There's nothing I can do for you. Don't waste my time.",
"If you can restore my blade to its highest quality, I'll overlook your sunny disposition. Here's ",
"Your rough attitude really appals me; but you'll prove your abilities if you can raise my sword to a fine level, for which I'll pay you ",
"I'm sorry you're not more pleased with it. But it ought to be easy enough for you to bring it up to an average state for ",
"Well. You'll have to forgive me coming to you with such an unworthy blade, Robierto. Just give it a basic job and I'll give you ",
"Fine. Don't count on seeing me again before too long.",
"Those prices just aren't worth your rough service, I'm afraid. Maybe another time.",
"Here, done. It was simple, really. Like mending a child's toy. Come back any time... just don't expect my attitude to have improved any.",
"I wouldn't dare be so presumptuous. Farewell.",
"Stop messing about! Either equip a blade for me to mend or be gone.",
"Let me see what you have in stock.",
" pieces of gold.",
"I brought with me quite a lot of blades. Would you be able to put them all in a better condition?",
"Do I look like a multi-armed Indian god? I don't waste my time repairing your crew's forks and clubs so they can break them on someone's head again. But my apprentices could help you out.",
"Please have them repair the most damaged blades, so each is at least of average quality. Take these ",
"If they could bring the blades up to good quality, I'd pay you ",
"I hope your apprentices know their trade. I'll only accept fine quality. Here's your ",
"I'm not quite sure what blades you are talking about.",
"Sorry, never mind.",
"What exactly do you want me to do with that rusty antiquity!?!? No blacksmith in the entire Caribbean could repair it, I'm afraid.",
"There's only one quality that's good enough for me - excellent. Take your ",
