"Nothing at the moment. Dismissed!",
"Captain, eh? Might you be looking for a fine officer to hire? I know the seas around here like the back of my hand, and always obey my captain's orders.",
"As it happens, I do need a navigator, and you look trustworthy enough. All right - welcome aboard, Gyles!",
"I don't need an officer right now. Maybe later.",
"Fine, fine. I'll be here when you change your mind.",
"You mean IF I change my mind, right? Well, maybe I will. Goodbye.",
