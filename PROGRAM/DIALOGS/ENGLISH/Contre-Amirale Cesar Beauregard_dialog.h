"#ssir#, why are you disturbing me? I hope this is very important.",
"Bonjour monsieur, I am here to visit the Governor - Madame de Cussy.",
"Bonjour monsieur, I am terribly sorry for interrupting you, but I wish an audience.",
"I am sorry #ssir#, but I am not the Governor. I am Contre-Amirale Cesar Beauregard, I have been sent by Louis XIV, himself assist our Governor to bring order in these buccaneer waters. Now tell me, why did you disturb me?",
"Work. I am seeking to aid France in her endeavours here.",
"I am listening.",
"In my travels, I have heard that the Spanish are treating French citizens with the utmost disregard.",
"The Spanish are known for their lack of respect for our countrymen. It is well known.",
"I am prepared to assist you. I have a sound ship and good crew and no love of the Spanish.",
"So you seek some covert operation?",
"Oui!",
"Mon Dieu!!! Do I look like a Madame?",
"My apologies, Monsieur. I shall leave you now.",
"Perhaps we can use you. But no one can know you are working for me.",
"And no one shall. What do you have in mind for me?",
"Non, it is all to risky for me. Perhaps another time, when I have a larger ship and more crew.",
"There is a rumour, that a Dutch smuggler is on it's way to #sSanto Domingo#, loaded with ammunition. They say that the Spanish are planning on retaking #sRedmond#. But why should France meddle in this?",
"Why, please tell me Contre-Amirale.",
"#sPort au Prince# is surrounded by Spanish settlements. If there would be a war, #sPort au Prince# would be swarmed by Spanish troops in no time. So we need to maintain the status-quo so to speak. So, I need you to intercept the Dutch Smuggler.",
"I will take the mission. Will there be a reward if I succeed?",
"5000 gold, 2500 now, and 2500 when you succeed. A tidy sum, no?",
"What have you heard about this Dutch ship?",
"The ship is called the 'Vogelstruijs' and it will leave #sisland_Douwesen# in 10 days, in order to pick up the ammunition at #sisland_Curacao#.",
"I will leave immediately!",
"Ah, you have returned!",
"Oui, with good news Contre-Amirale! I not only have information about the plans of the smuggler, I even have brought back the original letter from the Spanish!",
"That is very good news indeed. This is more than I had hoped for! Here is the rest of the money, as promised. Now, let me see this letter.",
"Voila, here it is.",
"A messenger after arrival... One of the patrols sighted a Dutch Pinnace just this morning, anchoring at Boca de Yuman. We have to act quickly before the Spanish arrive to unload the cargo!",
"I sail for Buca de Yuman now.",
"Safe journey and a swift return.",
"Ah, I hope you are the bearer of good news!",
"Oui, I am Contre-Amirale! I have successfully boarded the 'Vogelstruijs'. I lit her powder magazine myself. Who said ostriches couldn't fly!",
"Ha ha, you are quite a joker. Here is the other 2500 I promised you. You are free to go now, I have no more missions for now.",
"Thank you, Monsieur!",
