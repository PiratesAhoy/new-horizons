"Thank you very much. Keep in mind, if you don't deliver the cargo on time, I won't be able to finish it. I would then have to cancel the order and will be unable to pay you as well.",

"As promised, here is your pay. Thank you very much for getting these goods.",
"I couldn't get your whole delivery in one go, so here is the first part.",
"Ah, thank you very much. Please get the rest as soon as possible. I'm going to use these resources already, so if you don't deliver the rest I still have to cancel the order, but I can't return these resources either, just so you know.",
"You know what, I will keep them with me then until I have everything.",
"Today is your lucky day, I have what you need in the hold of my ship.",
