"Did you lose something, captain?",
"What do you mean and who are you?",
"Don't you remember a certain governor losing his daughter?",
"How do you know that?",
"You better leave it be or my captain will get involved. Got it!",
"I don't think so, unless you tell me who is your captain.", 
"It's Davy Jones of course.",
"Davy Jones?! Now I understand.",
"Well, I've lost enough time with you. So, drop it or you might find yourself dropped in the Locker!",
"In another circumstances, you would taste my blade but seeing that I'm not interested in finding myself in Davy Jones' Locker, I'll take my leave.",
"Hello captain. I wouldn't like to be in your situation. Davy Jones is waiting for you. Go and meet him!",
"I confess I've never liked this kind of family reunion.",
"Thought you could get away from us, Sparrow? How very wrong you were... Now follow us!",
"Guess I don't have an option.",
"Davy Jones is waiting for you by the shore. Go and meet him!",
"I confess I've never liked this kind of family reunion...",
"Well, well... Look who we have here! Visiting the lair of the king of the sea himself, are you? He is awaiting you in his cabin up the stairs!",
"Indeed I was looking to seek an audience with Mr. Jones... as it were.",
"You don't look as though you belong here. Perhaps after a few hundred years...",
"I don't intend to stay that long!",
