"Hello, stranger.",
"Hello.",
"You know, I did see one man here in pretty fine clothes, and I don't believe he carried a blade. He was talking with another man I didn't recognize. \n Then, out of the clear blue sky, bandits burst in and shot the man he was speaking to. \n Their victim is upstairs now, recovering from his wounds. If he's conscious, he may be able to help you find your missing crewman.",
"Thanks for your help.",
