"You'll answer me first! Where is ",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
"?",
"We've got you now! We've waited for you a long time. We know you're spying for the harbor master! You won't leave here alive!",
"As you wish.",
"What are you doing here?",
"I was sent here by a man in the tavern.",
"I don't know of any ",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
"! Get out! Now!",
"Hey, why are you all shaking? You aren't hiding anything from me, now are you?!",
"Get out, or I'll...",
"Or what? Let me guess, you'll call the guards? Well, sorry to disappoint you, but they're also looking for ",
"Teodoro Fernandez",
".",
"What do you want from me?",
"I just want to know what happened to the man who came here ten minutes ago.",
"He went out through the back door. I don't think you'll catch him now.",
"Then maybe you can tell me what he wanted?",
"Leave me be! I've told you what I know!",
"I see. Then what's in those papers you're hiding behind your back?",
"It's none of your business! It's just a letter from... eh, my niece!",
"Let me see, I'll read it aloud for you!",
"How dare you! Who the hell do you think you are?!",
"I'm ",
", my own captain and not accustomed to taking orders, and if you don't give me that letter right now, I'll be stirring your guts with my blade.",
"A pirate?!",
"You hit the nail on the head! So, I'll count to three. One...",
"Take it, damn you, just don't hurt me!",
"Ah, let's see... A niece, you say?",
"Leave me already!",
"Not so fast. I see you're buying contraband here. That's a slippery path to perdition.",
"What I do is none of your business!",
"Don't get too excited. You won't be at large for long. I think the officials will be quite interested in these documents.",
"Ah, ",
"Andre Juliao",
"!",
"Right, that was him.",
"Actually, he didn't introduce himself.",
"Get out, now!",
"What's wrong?",
"Now, I said! Before I call the guards!",
"As you wish.",
"Try it, and you'll regret it!",
"He never does, he-he.... Right, let's get down to business.",
"We should have long ago.",
"So, you need a certain specific commodity, captain?",
"Yes.",
"May I ask what for?",
"Well... I don't know yet, but it won't hurt to buy it anyway, right?",
"I was asked to buy it.",
"By whom?",
"Do you really think I'd tell you the name of my employer?",
"All right, I believe you. But, it will cost you... Argh... I always forget these numbers.",
"Hmph!",
"Oh, don't worry, I have it here. I just need to take a look at my papers.",
"Let me have a look at them too.",
"Hey! What are you doing?!",
"Put the papers on the table and step aside, or...",
"What?! Who are you?!",
"I am ",
", captain of a pirate ship no less. Let me make this simple. If you don't give me these papers right now, I may have to resort to less gentlemanly measures.",
"A pirate?! Oh no!",
"That's right, you've heard the stories, eh? Good. So, be nice and do what you're told to.",
"Take the papers, just don't hurt me!",
"That's better. Hmm, I see you've not only got a problem with numbers, you've got everything written down, including names...",
"You'll regret this!",
"I think you'll be the one with something to regret once I show these papers to the officials.",
