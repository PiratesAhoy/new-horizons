"Greetings.",
"Hello. Have you seen an officer by the name of Nigel Blythe? I can't imagine you see many ship's officers around here, so you should remember him.",
"Yes, there was one officer, now that you mention it. I seem to recall him talking to Emergildo Carminero - fat man, simple looking - his house is not far from here. \nThe entrance to his front garden is right behind this tavern. You'll see a small gate. You can't miss it.",
"Thanks. I appreciate your help.",
