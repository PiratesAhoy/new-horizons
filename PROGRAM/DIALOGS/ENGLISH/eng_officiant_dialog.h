"I'd be glad to have a chat with you if I weren't so busy. A good day for the tavern isn't always a good day for talking!",
"...",
"Oh, please, captain, don't start a drunken spree here! You can't imagine how hard is cleaning up afterwards!",
"Ahem...I wasn't thinking of any such thing.",
"Oh, captain! Wouldn't you like to sample my charms? I don't like to boast, but...",
"Sorry, babe, I'm in a hurry now. How about next time?",
"If you want to order a drink - talk to the owner. He is standing at the bar.",
"Thanks for advice.",
"If you want to have a rest and replenish your health - rent a room for a night. Mind you, sleeping in the common hall won't help you recover.",
"Thanks, that's good to know.",
"Are you awake?",
"Ohhh...",
"Are you all right? How's your head?",
"What the hell happened?",
"Don't you remember? You drank too much - fell asleep at the table - and then you were robbed!",
"What? Oh... my head.... Who dared...?",
"How should I know? It's a rough neighbourhood! They came in, threatened me, went through your pockets, and left.",
"All right. What's lost is lost. At least they didn't find my moneybelt.",
"Ah, hello, finally you're awake again. We are in ",
" tavern. You have been lying here in a comatose state for four days! We feared that you had already crossed the threshold to the netherworld.",
"Hmm, well, I may have been there actually. I met the demons of darkness, they were clutching their bony claws into me, but then a beautiful angel appeared out of a halo of heavenly light and drove them away... I wonder if that vision has a meaning. Maybe providence prevents my death until I have found my destiny... That angel... her face... it was somehow familiar... Dammit, I can't remember! I can't even think, my head is aching like mad...",
"Take care, you are still weak, and it may take some time to recover your full health. Don't torture your brain about that 'vision'. Our old surgeon looks a little odd with his grizzled wig, and he wasn't very gentle when he cleaned your wounds. He may well have appeared hellish to you in your state. And it was probably MY angelic face that you saw through your feverish eyes. I nursed you day and night, you know.",
"YOUR angelic face? Ehhh... Ah, yes, of course! But tell me, please, how did I get here?",
"It looks like you got wounded badly in a fight, almost fatally. Probably your enemies thought they had already killed you and left you for dead. But some members of your crew found you and brought you here.",
"Ah, it's good to have a faithful crew.",
"Hmm, not THAT faithful. When the news of your defeat spread and it seemed that you would never recover many sailors deserted you.",
"Traitorous bastards! And what about my beloved, beautiful ship?",
"Well, your ship is at anchor in ",
"the bay near ",
". Unfortunately, without your leadership the discipline of your crew went to the dogs. They broke into the spiritroom and got completely drunk last evening. Then a terrible squall hit them unawares, and your ship was driven against a rock. It took some damage, but it is still afloat. Our shipwright will surely be able to salvage and repair it.",
"Looks like I should get back to my quarterdeck as soon as possible. ",
"Where is my dunnage?",
"Here is all that you had still with you when you were found. But I am not sure if your enemies didn't plunder something.",
"Ah, never mind gold and weapons, as long as I still have my skills I will recover my possessions quickly. I must take my leave now, but I am indebted to you for your help. Thanks a lot, and goodbye.",
"You're finally awake!",
"What happened? I had a very strange dream...",
"Please hurry, there's no time to waste. You were robbed and what's more, you must leave immediately! We're in ",
" colony of ",
" where local authorities would prefer to see you hanging from the gallows. You have been lying here in a comatose state for four days!",
"If they didn't find me yet, apparently I was quite safe.",
"It seems that you have some dangerous enemies. They already informed the governor about your presence. In a short time soldiers will come here to arrest you.",
" For security reasons your crew, or rather loyal crewmembers who didn't desert, put your ship to sea last night and now she's anchored in ",
". They lack sailing experience and hit some reefs once or twice, but they took all the planks which appeared on the sea surface\nCalm down please, your ship is still afloat.",
"Right, I'd better move out of here. You saved my life and I'll never forget it.",
"I would be happy too, honey! I'm not busy the next couple of hours anyway.",
"Can I help you, ",
"?",
"Ah, it's you, ",
".",
"Yes? What can I do for you?",
"I wanted to talk to you about ",
", the local priest.",
"Some priest! He won't stop making advances. Can you imagine? I complained to everyone, but no one believes me.\nHe even wrote me love letters, if you please!",
"Are these the letters?",
"Yes, they are. You must have gotten them from ",
". So are you here because of his complaint?",
"How do you know he lodged a complaint?",
"Well, he told me about it when I brought him these letters.",
"All right. Thanks for your time. I'll let you get back to work.",
"Hey, Raymond! Is everything cancelled now? Do I have to return the money?!",
"...",
"I can't help you, sorry ",
", I have to watch the bar while ",
"Ines Diaz",
" is out the back.",
"Ok I will talk to you later then, love.",
"Oh, captain! I would like you to sample my charms! Unfortunantly the room is being used though.",
"Well that is no good, love.",
"Unfortunantly you can't rent a room for a night at the moment. Mind you, sleeping in the common hall is still an option.",
"Thanks, that's good to know.",
"Wow honey you must have been without a girl for a very long time ... well at least it was over quick",
"I'm sorry this normally never happens to me....",
"You told me to bring you nice specimens of animals. So I've got this bird here and I'd want you to have it.",
"Thank you very much!",
" I will study it and show it to Steven if I ever see him again.",
"You're welcome."
