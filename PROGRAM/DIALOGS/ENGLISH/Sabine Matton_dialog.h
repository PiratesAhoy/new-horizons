"Hello, my name is ",
", but my friends call me ",
".",
"It's very nice to meet you, ",
", my name is ",
". I am sorry but I have business to attend to, let's talk some other time.",
"Hello, beauty, my name is ",
", but for you I am just ",
". I'll see you later.",
"Hello! Judging by your name you are the daughter of the owner of this shop, aren't you?",
"Hey gorgeous, isn't that your dad standing there by the counter?",
"I am so glad to see you, ",
"!",
" Everyone in town is talking about you and your exploits!",
"Yes, yes, but I am in a hurry now.",
"Yes, I can be like that. I may be a little rude sometimes but I know my job very well. I have things to do now but I'll talk with you later.",
"...",
"...",
"...",
"...",
"...",
"I've heard a lot about you, ",
". Everyone says that you are the only female pirate...",
"People are mistaken, I am not a pirate, I am an honest captain.",
"I already asked you not to talk with me so unceremoniously. I am a captain, ",
", and don't call me otherwise. Do you understand me?!",
"You didn't change your mind, did you? Please, take me away from here!",
"People are wrong, I am not a pirate, I am an honest captain.",
"I already asked you not to talk with me so unceremoniously. I am a captain, ",
", and don't call me otherwise. Do you understand me?!",
"Oh, I am sorry, ",
".",
"Do you want to talk with me about something in particular or you are just wasting my time?",
"You are trying my patience with this idle chatter. Do you have some business for me or not?",
"I do have business for you. You are my last hope!",
"Judging by the tone of your voice you are planning some shady enterprise and you want me to be involved in it.",
"Wow, really! I am your 'last hope'? That's kind of interesting! All right, lay out what kind of business you have for me.",
"I am sorry but I don't have time for solving your problems.",
"That's nonsense, ask for help your daddy and don't prevent me from doing my business.",
"Thank you for agreeing to listen to me. The thing is that I can't stay with my father any longer. He is a good person but he wants to marry me to someone.",
"What's wrong with that for a girl like you?",
"So, what's wrong with getting married to someone. Once you get your hands on your husband, you can twist him round your little finger.",
"He wants to marry you to someone against your will? That's not fair, and I understand why you are angry with him, but how can I possibly help you?",
"Without asking you whether you agree to it or not? What a father! Such fathers should be strung from a yardarm! But still, I can't understand what you would want from me.",
"How come! I thought that you'd understand me for sure. I don't want to marry anyone! I want to be independent and free!",
"I'd say that you have pretty strange desires for a young woman but what do you want from me?",
"What can I say? Run away from home then. I don't see what this has to do with me.",
"Take me away from here, I beg you! I want to sail with you on your ship and admire the sea and...",
"Wait, wait, wait! You want me to basically kidnap you from your father?",
"Hey! Wait a second! You want me to risk my life in order to solve your petty problems?",
"No, I won't do that. You are a young and inexperienced girl. You'd all too soon regret that decision.",
"Aha, as if I don't have anything else to do but help you, I've got my own problems to solve.",
"Well, when I saw you I thought that you could help me but if you think this is 'petty'...",
"Calm down. Would you really prefer sailing to the comfort of a good home?",
"Stop sniveling! Do you really want to leave your house and that peaceful life for a life on the seas?",
"Well, I understand you very well but I do not think I have the right to meddle with your life. Live as everyone else lives and be happy.",
"You are right, your desires are just the petty whims of a spoiled, coddled girl.",
"Yes, I've been dreaming about traveling for several years. I want to see many different interesting places, meet new people and not hide behind my father's back and let him decide what I should do with my life.",
"All right, I can take you with me but please don't think that sailing is always care-free.",
"All right, all right. My ship is at the port and I'll inform my crew to allow you onboard, but if you complain about anything during the voyage I'll feed you to the sharks.",
"You are wrong. When you travel you not only see new and interesting places but often get in dangerous situations. YOu would be better off staying at home.",
"Well, don't hide behind your father's back then. Just live your life, enjoy it and do what you want, your father's opinions be damned! ",
"Oh, thank you so much, captain ",
", I am going to pack my things now and then I'll come to your ship.",
"Fine, but don't be late, we are going to set sail soon.",
"Don't even think of taking all of your clothes, take only what's necessary.",
"You are probably right, thank you.",
"Never mind. Now let me get busy with my things.",
"As you say, ",
". I don't dare to delay you any more.",
"Of course you don't dare. Don't put on airs, girl.",
"Yes, I'd like my father to be a captain so that I could sail with him and stand under the snow-white sails billowing in the sea breeze...",
"A nice dream, but we don't get to choose our parents. All right, I have some things to do.",
"Silly woman! A woman on the ship brings bad luck, so stay dry on land.",
