"We don't have our own governor, because we are under the jurisdiction of governor from #sRedmond#. He rarely visits here, so I don't know a lot about him. His laws are harsh, but I can't say that they are unjust. However, our fort needs repair, and instead of repairing, he spends money on various expeditions.",
"I see. Let me ask you another question.",
"Thank you. Goodbye.",
"He is very interesting. Sometimes I think that he'd be better employed as a spy. It's just fascinating how much he knows.",
"I see. Let me ask you another question.",
"Thank you. Goodbye.",
"He is very well-educated. They say he was studying in England and Holland. But then somehow he had some trouble with the authorities, and he came here.",
"I see. Let me ask you another question.",
"Thank you. Goodbye.",
"I can't say any bad about him. He is very honest. He is humble and compassionate, and I haven't heard a bad word about him from anybody.",
"I see. Let me ask you another question.",

"Where can I sell the goods I've brought with me?",
"If you're coming from the port, you just turn to the right from the town entrance, and you'll see the tavern. It's got a big sign.",
"I see. Thank you. Goodbye.",
"And where is the shipyard?",
"Where can I unload some of the cargo in my hold for a decent price?",
"The shipyard manager's office is at the end of the side street that runs to the left from the port's gate.",
"Got it. And how can I get to the tavern?",
"Where can I sell some of my goods?",
"Thanks for your help. That's all I need for now.",
"If you go straight from the port through the city entrance, you'll come to the store.",
"Where's the city's shipyard?",
"How can I get to the tavern?",
"I see. Thanks for your time.",
"That's kind of a general question. What do you want to know?",
"What exactly do you want to know?",
"What do you want to know, ",
"?",
"I'd like to know the history of the colony.",
"Is there anything on this island outside of the city?",
"Do you know anything about the fort that protects the city?",
"Let me ask you something else.",
"I'm pleased to hear you're interested in that, captain. So few people care about the past in this modern age. The colony was established about 40 years ago.\nThe island isn't big, but its soil is quite fertile, and there are a couple of very cozy bays. New areas have developed gradually, as well as the city itself.",
"Go on.",
"I see. I have another question, if that's all right.",
"As the colony got bigger, it became a bigger target for pirates - so the fort was built to protect the town. Since then, it's become more peaceful here.",
"I see. Let me ask you something else, if I may.",
"Most of the island is developed now, and it supports the citizens very well. But any further development will be difficult, thanks to the thick jungle.",
"Please, tell me more.",
"There's nothing really special about this particular island. They're all quite similar in the archipelago.",
"I see. Do continue.",
"There's nothing interesting to tell. Just jungle, rocks, and deserted beaches. The land is very fertile and brings rich crops, so of course there are farms and pastures.",
"Go on.",
"I see. Let me ask you something else, if I may.",
"I am not really interested in that.",
"That's too bad. Well, tell me something else.",
"Those who built the fort did their job very well. It isn't big, but it's quite advanced in its design. And it's home to 800 full-time soldiers.",
"I see. Continue...",
"The commander of the garrison could have me beheaded for telling you about the fort. Sorry, captain, but perhaps it's best if we speak of something else.",
"All right. ",
"I see. Let me ask you another question.",
"It's a Dutchman living here that I'd like to find. Yedam Kinne.",
"Ah, Kinne, yes. A handy man to know, for many reasons I...ahh... probably shouldn't mention. Lives behind the tavern.",
"Thank you. Goodbye.",
" We have a population of ",
" citizens.",
"When first English colonists landed on this island they found out that it was uninhabited. After they made some exploration of the land they discovered traces that some natives in fact inhabited the place where currently #sGreenford# is located.",
"Those people, Arawaks, abandoned the island, but left a primitive bridge -- thus, although this construction isn't seen here, the town was hence named '#sGreenford#'.",
"In 1536 Portuguese explorer Pedro a Campos landed on #sisland_Oxbay# when he was sailing to Brazil. He named the island 'Los Barbados', meaning 'the bearded ones', after he saw local fig trees, which have long aerial roots resembling a beard\n#sisland_Oxbay# was claimed for England by captain John Powell in 1625, and first colonists was brought here by his brother, Captain Henry Powell. After more colonists arrived, at the end of 1628, about 2000 people lived here\nSince the very beginning, colonists planted tobacco here, which now is one of the main export goods of the island.",
"Did you happen to see a religious man pass through here recently?",
"Now you mention it, indeed I did. But it was quite a while ago. I believe he went to the old church in the back part of the town. I don't believe he has been seen since. Perhaps the stories about that place being haunted are actually true...",
"Thank you for the information.",
"I heard you have an apothecary in town. Do you know anything about him?",
"Indeed we have. His shop is not far from the church, it's on the top floor of the house with the staircase outside.",
"Thank you! He certainly sounds worth visiting.",
"What else can you tell me about him?",
"Well, he's a keen naturalist and collects specimens of wild birds.\nAnd he sometimes needs help finding ingredients for his medicines.",
