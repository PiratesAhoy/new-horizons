"Hey, you there! You look suspicious to me. Who the hell are you? Show me your papers!",
"Who the hell are YOU? Identify yourself, and be quick about it!",
"Halt! I have never seen you before, but you have the face of a pirate! Can you prove that you are none?",
"I am ",
", and here are my comission and ship's papers to prove it. Was that quick enough for your rather short temper?",
"Oh, yes, of course, Sir! Here, my identification is in this purse, right below the 200 Gold. *WINK*",
"If you don't get lost at once I will show you how quick I am... with my blade!",
"Don't you dare to adress a superior in that manner again, you insolent hireling! Don't you know me? I am the Royal Inspector of His Majesty's Caribbean Regiments, and I have just arrived with the last ship to survey our troops here! Now don't molest me any longer, or you'll have to explain to your commander why I have missed my appointment with him!",
"Ah, yes, the picture on the coins identifies you as a man who has a heart for underpaid guards, hehe. Allright, I'll let you pass, but only this time. And behave!",
"Of course! Who do you think I am? A rogue? *WINK*",
"I don't trust you! ALARM! RAISE THE GUARDS!",
"Nice try, fella, but not with me! ALARM! A spy! Raise the Hue and Cry!",
"What's this? ALARM! A pirate!",
" Looks like my SKILLS were insufficient for THAT approach. Or was it just bad luck? Well",
" I hope my fencing will be more successful than my playacting...",
"Let me see... Well, everything in order. Sorry for having bothered you, Sir, but we must be very vigilant here. This Navy yard is a very tempting target for common thiefs and enemy spies and saboteurs alike. \nOnly too often they manage to sneak in, despite our guards at gate and waterfront. There must be some secret passage somewhere...",
"No problem...",
"Well, now that we have made our acquaintance you could tell me a bit about this harbour.",
"You look like a naval guy, you can surely tell me where I can get provisions for my ship.",
"With pleasure, Sir. #sSt John's# is no ordinary port but a naval base, actually one of the most important in the Caribbean, due to its strategic position near the main passage between Windward and Leeward Islands, and the fortifications are impregnable! We even had a hospital here, right beside the parade ground, but that has been moved out of the yard to a more... err... isolated place.",
"Sounds like I'll enjoy my stay here. Thanks for the hints, goodbye.",
"You look like a naval guy, you can surely tell me where I can get provisions for my ship.",
"Well, the naval yard office is at the end of the jetty. The big building near the jetty is the magazine of the Agent-Victualler. You'll find the portadmiral and the Captain of the Impress Service in Admiralty House, the mansion near the parade ground.\nBut as #sSt John's# is no ordinary port but a naval base its facilities are normally reserved for ships of our navy. Our privateers are being supplied if they pay for it, but all other ships won't get any stores or repairs here in port. \nThough I have heard that some navy officials are generous to you if you are generous to them, if you know what I mean. And as a last resort you can try the civilian traders in the outskirts of the harbour, and maybe you can hire some men there as well. But beware, there are lots of scum and cutthroats out there.",
"Makes me feel at home... Thanks for the hints, goodbye.",
"Interesting, and can you tell me a bit about this harbour in general?",
"It was just too dangerous to have all those diseased here. After all, whole regiments died of fever in the old hospital. Its ruins still remain cause nobody wants to use such an unhealthy site. Some even claim that the place is haunted \nThe whole harbour is a military area, so you'll meet few civilians here. Apart from those thieves or saboteurs! So be on your guard if you see some suspicious figure.. Speaking of thieves, there is a small civilian settlement in front of the naval station's gate: a slum with cheap taverns where sailors are being plundered and crimped, and cheating traders who sell you back what the muggers took away from you before...",
"But... Why is that?",
