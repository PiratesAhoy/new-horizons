"I'm sorry. I've got to be going.",
"...",
"I beg of you, ",
"! Please help me!",
"What's going on here?",
"They want to kill the old man!",
"So where are the soldiers? It's their job to maintain order in this town, not mine.",
"The soldiers have to live here - you don't! And you seem like a decent fellow - won't you please save that poor old man? These barbarians are going to burn him!",
"Why? What did he do?",
"Are you going stand here questioning me while they kill him?",
"The crowd is just getting the fire ready. You've got plenty of time to answer my questions.",
"How can you be so calm?!",
"Call it a job requirement. Now they're tying the old man to the stake. You might want to speak before it's too late.",
"All right! He is accused of sorcery - but believe me, he's just a normal man. He lives alone in the lighthouse and never bothers anyone!",
"So why is the crowd so keen on roasting him? And why are you the only one who wants to save him?",
"He's a harmless crackpot. He's always got some new invention, and most of them don't work the way they're supposed to - so he's annoyed a lot of people.",
"Yes - they do seem rather annoyed.",
"Well, something exploded at his lighthouse this morning, and the wind carried a stinking cloud over the whole city.",
"Must've been some cloud, to warrant burning him at the stake. But again - why do you alone want to save him?",
"My daughter once fell deathly ill, and no one could help her. But ",
"researcher",
" found a cure for her in an old Indian manuscript!",
"Well, he does sound worth saving. I'll do what I can. What did you say his name was? ",
"researcher",
"?",
"That's a very touching story. But I'm not sure it's touching enough to move me against a murderous mob.",
"Oh, bless you! You're doing a very good thing!",
"I'll do my best.",
"Have you no heart, sir?! You're no better than those murderers building the fire!",
"No heart?! I've got a heart like a whale! If I have to prove it to you, I will!",
"I may be heartless, but I can't stand by and watch this happen. I'll help the old man if I can.",
