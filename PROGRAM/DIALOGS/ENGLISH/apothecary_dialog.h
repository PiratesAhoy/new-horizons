"Joy of the day to you, captain. Pray, come into my medico chamber.",
"Why hello. You a sawbones?",
"Sorry, can't stay. Got things to do.",
"I give you joy of your return, captain. How might I apply my humble medical knowledge to your most particular case?",
"I'd submit myself to almost any procedure just now if only you can restore my strength, dear doctor.",
"As we're on the topic of contemporary medicine, will you prescribe something to augment might, stamina and resiliance?",
"I'd like to buy some bottles of physic to take with me, if you please.",
"My dear Steven! You've been most kind, but I fear I must leave you now. I wish you all luck in your scientific persuits.",
"Captain, I perceive you have been poisoned! You must permit me to let blood immediately. Only hold still there, and I advise you to look away. I've known plenty of otherwise raucous sailors more than willing to shed another's blood but who faint at the sight of their own...",
"Oog, yes, please hurry...",
"If you choose to use such a crude term, then yes, I am in the profession of dismembering the ossified bits of my fellow man. With a bow may I introduce myself as ",
", your humble servant.",
"Heh, dismembering. Would you fancy, that's my gig too. Tell me about your little shop here... for instance, why are the colours so unsettling?",
"As for the schema chromata, science has shown such shades as these to be soothing to the patient, aiding both in recovery and digestion. I am an apothecary by trade, and as you may discern by the zoological collection about, a bit of an amateur naturalist. If you have any medical needs, you will be safe in my most capable hands.",
"Splendid: I am in need of your services, so that I might recover my full strength.",
"A little bloodletting or the application of leeches, combined with a powerful enematic, will lift any grizzled seaman's spirits as well as his health. And I charge only 200 coins. Shall we proceed?",
"Sounds perfectly thrilling, I can't wait.",
"I don't quite know what any of that is, but it all sounds extremely unpleasant. If it's all the same to you, Steven, I'll stay wounded.",
"Ah, good, I see you have the chemical constituents I specified. I trust it was no trouble to find them all.\nFor whom should the prescription be?",
"For me personally.",
"For my officer ",
".",
"I fear I must insist against such a course, considering the time and expense. Maybe another time.",
"Yes, I can do such a thing. Only you must bring me the ingredients I need for such a healthful, life-prolonging embrocation, as they are not part of my common stock. This is what is required: Find a bottle of acetum saturninum, a drachm of confectio Damocritis, an ounce of laudenum and several grains of turpeth. Can you remember all that? You may be able to find them in casks and boxes throughout the archipelago... only captain, please don't resort to stealing.",
"Never in life, my good doctor. I'll gather your shopping list post-haste, and return to meet my fate as a stronger #sgender#.",
"Captain, pray tell, is that a species of Albatross I spy in your possession? How I do love the dear, stupid birds - in my capacity as an amateur naturalist, I've made their type the main object of my study. Shall I give you this jar of healing leeches in exchange for it?",
"Well, I don't know if I want to part with such a magnificent specimen... but very well, let's trade.",
"Certainly not, doctor. For one, I've grown rather fond of this noble bird... nor does a jar of slimey squishy little critters appeal as a trade for it. Sorry.",
"Certainly, of course. My medicine chests hold the finest and most able panacea you will yet find in all the realm of the Caribs. First and foremost might I suggest a jar of these wonderful little creatures here, these leeches? They are universally lauded among men of my profession, highly recommended for the removal of ill humours. I personally swear by them. 300 coins, if you please #ssir#, is a modest price.",
"Very well. I believe I can put stock in any recommendation of yours, my dear surgeon. One jar, please.",
"Ughk, what ARE those slimey little things in that jar?! You'd actually have me TOUCH one? Forgive a squeamish cutthroat, but no thank you!",
"There we go -- the ill humours have left you, and only clean, fresh blood remains. Verily, modern science is a wonder!",
"I heartily agree -- we've come so far from the barbarism of ancient days. Thank you.",
"Think nothing of it; your good health is my joy. And now there's only the matter of the bill.",
"Hm, had to be a catch. 100 piestres? A fair price for my life, I suppose. There you are.",
"Several quite unpleasant procedures later",
"you have quite recovered your health,",
"if not your spirits.",
"Following treatments ",
" feels as though ",
" might withstand stronger blows,",
"and generally live a bit longer.",
"+ ",
" max HP",
"I'm afraid I must insist on charging for the procedure (a mere ",
" coins), and as for your part you must remain overnight in 'dry-ducks', as you seamen say, though I haven't the least clue why, since waterfoul, as befits their name, are most often wet.\nShall we get underway?",
"Please begin.",
"I have changed my mind.",
"I have acquired some opium, but I wonder what it does. Can you enlighten me?",
"Yes, I know about this. A risky substance indeed! It may poison you or leave you weaker than you were before, though there is also a chance you may gain new knowledge and experience in this unconventional way. But even in the best case, the user would be left feeling sick afterwards. The effect wears off after a few days, but can affect your fencing abilities. Tread carefully!",
"That answers my question quite nicely. Thanks for the advice!"
