"The governor flatters me. Although I do have a great deal of experience with trouble....",
"Captain, have you changed your mind about helping me find my son?",
"Yes, I think I can help you now. But I'll need something to start with. Can you at least give me a general idea of where I should look?",
"I'm sorry, admiral, but I can't help you at the moment.",
"Captain! Have you found my boy?",
"I haven't yet, admiral. But don't worry. I will.",
"Ah, captain! Right on time!",
"I've got news about your son, admiral...",
"Captain, are you still here? What you are waiting for?!",
"Relax. I'll find your son.",
"Captain, your help has been priceless! I will never forget it.",
"I'm just pleased that everything turned out well.",
"Perfect. I have some business for you, captain. You see, my son, ",
"Lucas Da Saldanha",
", disappeared from home several months ago, only days before he was to marry. As you can imagine, it was quite an embarrassment to me.",
"Yes, of course.",

"I'll do all I can. Farewell.",
"I know it will be difficult to find him. But I still have my hopes. If you have any news at all, you can find me here.",
"Farewell, admiral.",
"Pardon the interruption, but time is short. Here is 3000 gold for your trouble. Now, listen carefully: I've been informed that ",
"Lucas Da Saldanha",
" has been captured by pirates. They demand a ransom of 20000 gold.",
"I see. What do you intend to do? ",
"I'm going to pay the ransom, of course! ",
"Lucas Da Saldanha",
" is worth more to me than mere gold. He's my son! Please, deliver this money to the pirates, and bring my son here unharmed. You will receive the 10000 gold I promised you.",
"I'll do it. Where do I take the ransom?",
"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid this mission has become too dangerous for me to continue. Goodbye, admiral.",
"To #sFalaise de Fleur#. One of the pirates will be waiting for you in the tavern there. I'll show you the special sign I was given, so he'll be sure to recognize you. And remember - if the pirates don't get the ransom within a month, they will kill ",

"Don't worry, admiral. Your son will be here soon.",
"I'm happy to give you these 10000 gold, captain. You've certainly earned it. I wish you luck!",
"Thank you, sir. Goodbye.",
