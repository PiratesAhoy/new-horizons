"Quiet! I have a business proposition for you.",
"What kind of proposition?",
"I've heard that one of the governor's men will come for you soon and take you to #sRedmond#.",
"No! The governor will skin me alive!",
"That sounds about right. He does seem to have a serious grudge against you.",
"Tell me something I don't know. So what do you propose?",
"How about I open this cell so you can escape?",
"And why would you do that?",
"I'm a very practical man.",
"I'll take your word for it. But what's in it for you?",
"It's simple, really. I've lost a lot of money playing cards with the local lads...",
"What are you saying? You want me to kill those poor devils in exchange for my freedom? Some of them may well be friends of mine!",
"Look, you're in serious trouble. Unless you want to stay here and wait for our beloved governor to hang you, you'd best shut up and do what I tell you!",
"All right. What choice do I have? Open the cell.",
