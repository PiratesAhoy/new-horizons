"Aye, Fred Bob be a tellin' de crew tew hoist ",
" colors.",
"Thank you.",
"Ahoy, ",
". Fred Bob ain't had de honor o' makin' yer acquaintance. He be reckonin' yer prolly Captain o' dat ship o'er yonder in de harbor.",
"I'm ",
". What ship are you talking about, exactly?",
"Is that so? Well, right now, I don't have time for any idle talk.",
"De one jus' beyond de purty lil' Portogee schooner. Ain't dat right, ",
"How'd you guess?",
"That may indeed be my ship, but it's really none of your business. Good day.",
"'Tweren't hard tew figger out, ",
", spotted ye comin' tew shore in yer launch. I be Fred Bob an'... Fred Bob be me!",
"Ah, so you're Fred Bob. I've heard tell you might be a good boatswain. What are you doing here? And why aren't you at sea?",
"I see. Well, it was nice speaking with you.",
"Aye, Fred Bob be a bo'sun, prolly one o' de best, ye kin be askin' most anybody! De problem be Fred Bob's been accused o' breakin' his ship's Artikles an' wrongly accused at dat!",
"Wrongly how? What exactly happened?",
"That's unfortunate. Well, good luck and good day!",
"Aye, ",
". De problem be Fred Bob's been accused o' breakin' his ship's Artikles an' wrongly accused at dat!",
"Wrongly how? What exactly happened?",
"That's unfortunate. Well, good luck and good day!",
"Dat lame-brained First Officer from me old ship be takin' sumptin' Fred Bob be sayin' all de wrong way! So here be Fred Bob under arrest an' on parole walk from dat blasted stockade up yonder!",
"Arrested! What did you say to him?",
"At least they let you out to walk around and get some exercise. Well, good luck and good day!",
"Well, Captain, Fred Bob be objectin' tew de way de First Officer be handlin' sumptin' dat happened wid a crewmate. So Fred Bob be givin' him an earful o' reasonin' in private, but jus' de same, he didn't much like takin' dem werds from Fred Bob. He be sayin' dat Fred Bob be speakin' mutiny! Of all de crazy, wrong-headed, an' stupid thangs!",
"Mutiny! No wonder they put you in the stockade!",
"Yep. Wid no witnesses, it truly be his word against mine, so thar really be no helpin' Fred Bob. Dat First Officer be from an upper-crust family an' be knowin' lots o' impordant peoples, whilst ol' Fred Bob jus' be a bo'sun wid nobody's help.",
"Are you sure there's nothing to be done about this?",
"So I take it no one's come along and ventured to help you out yet, right?",
"Well sure, supposin' some fairly well respected captain be comin' along an' be puttin' in a good werd fer ol' Fred Bob tew dat Captain o' de Guard. Prolly just a matter of time, ",
"Hmm... I might be able to see if I can do something about it.",
"I could talk to the Captain of the Guard, but I would need something from you in order to do that.",
"Sorry, I just don't think there's anything I can do.",
"Thar ye go, ",
"?! Goodness sakes o' live, if ye kin help out, ye sure won't be regrettin' it, matey! Fred Bob'll be makin' sure about dat!",
"I be believin' ye... uh, I believe you. But that really won't be necessary.",
"Well, actually, I don't think I really have time to help you.",
"Aye, Fred Bob be a smokin' yer meanin' thar. So yer generosity be havin' a price now does it, ",
"? Fred Bob be havin' lil' sumptin' tew offer ye, so don't be worryin'.",
"Really? Well let's hear about it, then.",
"Not likely. I don't think so. Good day to you.",
"Nosiree, Captain! If'n ye be helpin' Fred Bob, den Fred Bob'll be returnin' ye de favor, dat just be Fred Bob's way!",
"What do you mean by that?",
"Well then, thar ain't much fer Fred Bob tew do 'cept keep watchin' de ships go in an' out o' de harbor. Fair winds, Captain!",
"Consider yourself lucky you're not in chains. Goodbye.",
"Fred Bob got him dis here letter he be a findin' on a dead pirate. Be listenin' tew dis! It be promisin' a reward in gold tew whoever be deliverin' it tew a certain somebody. Fred Bob hain't had time tew find out if'n it be fer real or not. Fred Bob be gittin' hisself thrown in de slammer shortly after he be findin' it!",
"Hmm... That's rather intriguing. All right, I'll go talk to the Captain of the Guard about you. Where might I be finding him?",
"Head fer de middle of town in de part whar de Governor's Mansion be. He usually be strollin' about gawkin' after de ladies an' a hagglin' wid dem street merchants! His name be Ol' Fart or sumthin' like dat.",
"Ummm, Old Fart?",
"Dat's wat his men be callin' him, anyway. Ol' Fart. Fred Bob heard dem talkin' one night.",
"All right... Ummm, thank you....I think.",
"Aye, Captain ",
"! Passin' by once again thar.",
"Ahoy thar, ",
". Fred Bob figured he prolly not be seein' ye back by here again",
"Ah, thar ye be again, ",
". Glad tew see ye be safe an' sound.",
"Tell me again about your situation, Fred Bob.",
"Hello. Sorry I'm busy. Goodbye!",
"Aye, dat be de truth thar, ",
". But dats all right! Fred Bob be hard at werk on his harbor watch, wearin' a nice pretty figure-eight here in de sand! \nNow if'n ye be happenin' tew spring me, matey, ye gits de opportunity tew hire a competent bosun an' possibly sumptin' else worath havin' as well!",
"All right, I'll try to help you.",
"So, if I were to help you, what would be it for me?",
"I'm sorry but I just don't think it's wise to interfere with political problems. Farewell.",
"Thar ye go, ",
"?! Goodness sakes o' live, if ye kin help out, ye sure won't be regrettin' it, matey! Fred Bob'll be makin' sure about dat!",
"I be believin' ye... uh, I believe you. But that really won't be necessary.",
"Well, actually, I don't have time to help you.",
"Aye, Fred Bob be a smokin' yer meanin' thar indeed. So yer generosity be havin' a price now does it, ",
"? Fred Bob may be havin' a lil' sumptin' tew offer ye, so don't be worryin'.",
"Well let's hear about it, then.",
"Not likely. I don't think so. Good day to you.",
"Nosiree, Captain. If'n ye be helpin' Fred Bob, den Fred Bob be returnin' ye de favor, dat just be Fred Bob's way!",
"Let me first talk to the Captain of the Guard. Where might I find him?",
"Well then, thar ain't much fer Fred Bob tew do 'cept keep watchin' de ships go in an' out o' de harbor. Fair winds, Captain!",
"Consider yourself lucky you're not in chains. Goodbye.",
"Fred Bob got him dis here letter he be findin' on a dead pirate. Be listenin' tew dis! It be promisin' a reward in gold tew whoever be deliverin' it tew a certain somebody.

"Hmm... That's rather intriguing. All right, I'll go talk to the Captain of the Guard about you. Where might I be finding him?",
"Aye, it be Captain ",
"! Passin' by once again.",
"Ahoy thar, ",
". Fred Bob figured he prolly not see ye back here again.",
"Ah, thar ye be again, ",
". Glad tew see ye safe an' sound.",
" Have ye had any success?",
"I'm about to head over to see the Captain of the Guard right now.",
"Where did you say I might find the Captain of the Guard?",
"Not yet. I'm sorry, let's talk later.",
"Arr, don't let Fred Bob be a rushin' ye, Captain ",
"! Me brains might be a bit addled from de sun, but Fred Bob still be hard at werk on harbor watch an' wearin' a nice pretty figure-eight here in de sand!",
"You won't be under arrest for long. Not if I can help it.",
"Listen, I've got a couple of questions for you. You're an experienced seaman, aren't you?",
"Dat be music tew ol' Fred Bob's ears, ",
" an' de drinks be on Fred Bob later on!",
"We can down a few drinks together in the Tavern when I get back.",
"Ye be purty hard pressed tew find ye a bo'sun mo' bettah den Fred Bob 'tween here an' #sTortuga#, ",
"Then share your experience with me.",
"Hmm, well, all right, I'll see you later.",
"Cain't hardly give no advice 'bout navigation or maneuverin' since Fred Bob ain't be no ship's master. But as fer udder thangs... Fred Bob'll be glad tew larn ye a thang or two.",
"I'm glad of it. Go on, Mister Fred Bob. What can you tell me about what every captain should know?",
"Perfect. What can you tell me about what every captain should know?",
"How should I treat my crew?",
"How about a couple of seafaring tips?",
"Arrr! Fred Bob be tellin' ye thar be some thangs dat be vital fer any seaman. Dat be why we gotta larn dem ourselves so's not tew git caught wid our pants down!",
"What do you mean?",
"First an' foremost be defence. If'n a cap'n cain't properly set his crew at thar stations, den heavy fire will be a splatterin' yer deck wid blood. De mo' bettah yer defence, de fewer de dead an' wounded.",
"Continue, I'm listening to you.",
"Thank you for clearing that up for me, Mister Fred Bob. As you were.",
"I see. Thank you for clearing that up for me",
"Ne'er neglect yer crew, unlest ye gots an itchin' to be run aground or set adrift. Yer crew be de heart o' de ship an' no cap'n kin run his ship by his ownself. If'n ye hain't got 'nough hands, den de ship be as awkward as a cachalot.",
"Yes, I agree. I've learned early that 'ordinary seamen' are seldom ordinary. Go on, is there more?",
"Have ye a good cook aboard... an' feed yer men well. Let 'em fish or drop nets o'er de side fer fish an' shrimp when they be off duty. A well-fed crew be a happy crew.",
"Shrimp and fish. Got it.",
"Aye, Fred Bob'll be givin' a bit o' sage advice fer newer captains, who often be a runnin' headlong into battle an' kin get caught off guard by sheer numbers. When ye be a tryin' tew escape, remember it be mo' bettah tew be losin' yer cargo den yer head.",
"I see. Anything else?",
"Thank you for your advice, Mister Fred Bob. As you were.",
"Farewell, thank you for your advice.",
"Next thang ye be needin' tew know 'bout be swordplay. Some be sayin' dat only a captain need know 'bout dat, but seamen be a needin' tew have a bit of knowin' 'bout it too, specially when ye be boarded. An' if'n ye keep yer crew happy, thar be no need tew worry 'bout dem a usin' their swords on you!",
"That's sound advice, Mister Fred Bob.",
"That's sound advice, friend.",
"I guess that's enough information for me for today, Mister Fred Bob. As you were.",
"I guess that's enough information for me for today. Farewell.",
"'Member dat morale be most important fer yer crew. If de crew ain't be happy wid their captain, mutiny may soon be a knockin' at yer door.",
"Let's change the subject, Mister Fred Bob.",
"Let's change the subject.",
"Thank you, Mister Fred Bob, that was quite enlightening. As you were.",
"Thank you, that was quite enlightening. Goodbye.",
"Lissen tew what Fred Bob be a sayin', ",
". Ne'er be a fightin' wid dem city guards. They don't ne'er fight fair, no how. They'll be attackin' ye all at once an' just tie ye hand an' foot. It be easier tew fight off twenty scurvy ol' pirates den four o' dem guardsmen.",
"Let's change the subject, Mister Fred Bob.",
"Let's change the subject.",
"Thank you, Mister Fred Bob, we'll talk about it some other time. As you were.",
"Thank you, we'll talk about it some other time. Goodbye.",
"One mo' impordant thang be about how ye be boardin' yer enemy. Yer crew be needin' tew learn how tew throw dem grapplin' hooks and lash dem yards wid rope tew de ship ye be boardin'. They'll be needin' tew do it quick as lightnin' at yer werd o' command.",
"You sure are full of information, Mister Fred Bob.",
"You sure are full of information, Fred Bob.",
"Thank you, Mister Fred Bob, that was quite helpful. As you were.",
"Thank you, that was quite helpful. Goodbye.",
"Well Captain ",
", ol' Fred Bob be supposin' he might be gittin' a wee bit carried away thar... waxin' eloquent an' all.",
"All right, Mister Fred Bob. Let's change the subject.",
"All right. Let's change the subject.",
"Thank you for the information, Mister Fred Bob. As you were.",
"Thank you for the information. Goodbye.",
"Arr, Captain ",
"Ahoy, ",
". Weren't thinkin' we'd be meetin' again...",
"Aye, it be ye again, ",
". Glad tew see ye be safe an' sound.",
" Thar be any news?",
"Alas Fred Bob, I didn't manage to do anything.",
"Not yet, I'm sorry, let's talk later.",
"Dat's too bad, matey, but thankee anyways fer yer help,",
"I'm really sorry, Fred Bob. I tried my best.",
"Listen, I've got a couple of questions for you. You are an experienced Boatswain, aren't you?",
"Arr, Captain! Any news on how thangs be lookin' fer Fred Bob?",
"I think we both should have a drink, Fred Bob.",
"I haven't solved this problem yet.",
"Lookin' purty bad, eh, ",
"On the contrary, you're a free man now. The Captain has released you!",
"Ha Ha! Thankee thar, Captain! Truth be told, thar be no way Fred Bob be a believin' dat ye'd be able tew do dat!",
"Hmm, you seem to have underestimated my talents.",
"Aye, how true indeed, wid thangs lookin' so grim fer Fred Bob! Delighted ye be able tew do it! Now be tellin' ol' Fred Bob what kin he be doin' fer ye, Captain ",
"? Which way ye be a headed now?",
"To tell the truth, I promised to hire you and take you off this island. I could use a good Boatswain. Will you join my crew?",
"Fred Bob be de man fer de job, ",
"! Umm, he sure could be usin' a bit o' gold to hep finish off some bidness here.",
"How much do you need?",
"500 gold an' understandin' dat ain't exactly pocket change. Here be dat letter, Captain ",
", and by Fred Bob's word, it be yers, make no mistake.",
"Ah yes, the letter. Thank you Fred Bob... Don't worry, here is the money.",
"Thankee thar, Captain! Ye won't be a regrettin' dat gold when ye be seein' Fred Bob in action!",
"I hope so.",
", Captain. Good tew see ye an' glad yer still alive. It be dangerous bein' a captain these days.",
"Listen Fred Bob, could you please tell me about what makes a good captain once again?",
"Well, I think I know that. Goodbye.",
"Currently we be on ",
" food rations an' ",
" rum rations. We gots enough food fer ",
" days an' enough rum fer ",
" days, follerin' our current rations. Ye be a wantin' tew change de rations, Captain?",
"Yes, let's go to full food rations and normal rum rations.",
"Yes, let's go to half food rations and normal rum rations.",
"Yes, let's go to full food rations and double rum rations.",
"Yes, let's go to half food rations and double rum rations.",
"Aye aye! Full food an' normal rum rations it be, Captain.",
"Very good, Mister Fred Bob. As you were.",
"Aye aye! Half food an' normal rum rations it be, Captain.",
"Aye aye! Full food an' double rum rations it be, Captain.",
"Aye aye! Half food an' double rum rations it be, Captain.",
"Ye be a needin' tew divide de plunder first thar, Captain.",
"Oh, never mind.",
"A salary!? Ye be sure 'bout dat, sir? Dat ain't what de crew be signin' on fer.",
"Yes, I am sure. And I don't care how many desert!",
"Sign artikles!? Ye be sure 'bout dat, sir? Dat ain't what de crew be signin' on fer.",
"Yes, I am sure. And I don't care how many desert!",
"Aye aye! Fred Bob'll be informin' de crew. But be warned--some o' dem may be jumpin' ship.",
"Thank you.",
"Aye aye! Fred Bob'll be informin' de crew. But be warned--some o' dem may be jumpin' ship.",
"What sorta colors ye be wishin' tew fly, Captain?",
"Our current ",
" colors.",
"Leave my own colors.",
"Pirate colors.",
"My own colors.",
"Aye, Captain! Has ye got any orders?",
"What's the status of our provisions?",
"We're done with privateering. Now you all will be paid a salary.",
"Let's sign articles.",
"No, stand at ease.",
"I don't seem to fit in quite right in this world...",
"I think we'd both feel better if you found another situation, Fred Bob.",
"Next time we board, you're coming over with me.",
"Why don't you sit out the next boarding.",
"Stay here!",
"Follow me, and make it snappy!",
"Bring down our colors; we're flying a new flag.",
"What's our layed up ships status?",
"I need to change my clothes.",
"Give me the benefit of your vast mariner's wisdom, Fred Bob.",
"Aye aye, Captain.",
"As ye say, Captain! But if'n ye be firin' me, Fred Bob'll prolly never be returnin' tew yer ship. So, ye be decidin', matey.",
"Well. I have changed my mind. I still need you.",
"I'm sorry, but you have to go. That's my decision.",
"Yarr! It be Captain ",
"! Glad tew see ye safe an' sound. Fred Bob be figurin' he prolly not be seein' yew agin... Ye be a missin' ol' Fred Bob?",
"Ummm, well to tell you the truth, yes. I'm sorry I fired you. Will you come back to my ship?",
"Well, no, not at all. Goodbye.",
" agin! Me thinks ye prolly be missin' ol' Fred Bob.",
"Actually I have reconsidered. I'm sorry I fired you. Will you come back to my ship?",
"Fred Bob be tellin' ye earlier, Captain. Ye plumb be out o' luck thar. Fred Bob already be findin' a bettah place wid a bigger share o' de spoils!",
"Boy, did I screw up! Are you sure you won't be my Boatswain again?",
"Onliest way Fred Bob be a comin' back tew yer ship be if'n ye be offerin' him bettah pay.",
"Fine, I'll pay you 1000 gold.",
"Better pay? Never mind.",
"Nosirree ",
", dat piddly lil' offer truly be insultin' tew ol' Fred Bob. Me skills be worth bettah scratch den dat!",
"Hmmm, you are right, you know. Then 2000 it is!",
"Sorry, Ah cain't do... Err, I can't do better. Farewell, Mister Fred Bob.",
"Dat be mo' bettah ",
", but dat ain't be up tew Fred Bob's curren' sitchyashun.",
"All right, will 2500 do?",
"Sorry, I won't go higher. Farewell, Mister Fred Bob.",
"Dere ye go, Captain ",
", dat be what Fred Bob be a waitin' tew hear! Yer offah be accepted.",
"Very good, Mister Fred Bob, glad to have you back.",
"What manner of pirate be ye, Captain? Right now ye be known as ",
"a",
"An ",
"A ",
"an ",
"a ",
" and we presently ain't tellin' ye about no sightings unlest thar be a chance to beat dem.",
" and we presently tell ye about all ships dat we be spottin'.",
"I want to change standing orders regarding powerful enemy vessels.",
"Aye aye.",
"Aye aye. Now we won't be a botherin' ye wid sightings we cain't take.",
"Aye aye. Now we'll be tellin' ye about all de sightings.",
"Fine. Fred Bob'll be tossin' a net o'er de side an' be catchin' him some dinner!",
"Very good.",
"What ye be wantin' tew wear?",
"What I'm wearing now.",
"I wanna be just like my twin brother, Fred Bob!",
"I'm itching to go native!",
"The usual.",
"I think I fancy some dreadlocks...",
"A nice black coat and hat.",
"Your average naval officer's uniform.",
"I think of myself as a dashing French corsair.",
"But maybe a bit shabbier.",
"I think the storm's turned my hair white! And I don't feel like putting on the dog, either...",
"I've been liftin' the Knippels lately, so you better buy large...",
"That storm took a lot out of me; I'm tired and my mood's a little darker.",
"I've been putting it on around the middle, so buy husky-sized.",
"You know, maybe I am a Portugeuse swordsman after all...",
"Oh, something simple, and how about a bandana for my head?",
"Oh, something simple--as long as it doesn't clash with my darker skin",
"I think I'll dress down for a while. Just mug a bum for me.",
"Maybe I need glasses after all, and besides a place to put my pencils.",
"Did I tell you about my twin brother Will?",
"I think I made the List!",
"I finally got my own flag!",
"Well, seems I'm missing more than my clothes from that storm!",
"Get me a good Captain's uniform, something Othello would be proud of!",
"My forebears were Moors, and I want to live up to their example.",
"You know my old boatswain?",
"You know, as the years go by I start looking more and more like my cousin Ralph Fawn...",
"Just get me my old captain's uniform, but I think I'm gettin' too old for this!",
"Now yer talkin'!",
"Thankee thar, bro'!",
"Ye got it, man!",
"Aiyeeee!",
"Aye, Fred Bob'll be havin' de clothes ready fer ye.",
"Thanks.",
