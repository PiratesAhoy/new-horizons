"I found this weird book and I thought you might know what it is.",
"Let me see, #schild#. Hmmm... this is very special! I think I know what you have here, my #schild#, but I do not feel comfortable talking about this with you. Maybe you could first show me a sign of good faith?",
"What say you if I donate some money to the church?",
" I know you have given much already but there is one more thing for me to ask of you.",
"What is it you need?",
"As you have noticed, the Caribbean is still filled with all kinds of pagan stuff. Some of the tribes living on the islands are even possesed by demons. So our exorcists have their work cut out for them. But not all of them return safely home.",
"Are you asking me to do an exorcism?",
"No, of course not my #schild#. Doing that takes years of practice. I have something more simple for you in mind. We require a holy cross to perform an exorcism, but we have been running low on these and it will take at least a few more months before a new supply arrives from the Vatican. Yet I have seen them being sold at the markets and shops all over the Caribbean as well. Could you fetch me one of those?",
"That should not be a problem.",
"I'm sorry, but I thought you had a real job for me. Bye!",
"Oh, thank you very much! Please return the cross as soon as possible. God bless you on this journey.",
"I will be back before you know it!",
"I have brought the item you asked for.",
"Thank you so much, this could really save the life of people here. As special reward, you can have this item. I must admit I don't know what it actually does. One of our best exorcists had it made after he found some drawings in the vaults of the Vatican. They say it is an invention of someone who lived in Florence many years ago. If you want to know more about this item, you might be able to track down this exorcist personally.",
"Where could I find him?",
"He was last seen in ",
" so I think you should look there. Normally you can find him if you look for the weird and dangerous as it is his job to get rid of these. He might not appreciate that I gave you this item since it was made for him. But we will make him another one when he needs it.",
"Thank you very much. I will certainly look there.",
"Well, I did find a book with weird things which I have yet to find out about.",
"Ah, I know what this is! This book contains all kind of exorcisms. It seems our brave mister Winchester finally found his match. By now I also found out what the item you got is supposed to do. You can add this to the gun which our dear mister Winchester was carrying. This should allow you to aim better with it. I hope you found his gun as well, otherwise you may want to go back and look a bit closer.",
"Thank you very much for the information.",
"No, of course not my #schild#. The book you hold contains all kind of incantations for exorcism. I recognise this book it seems our brave mister Winchester finally found his match. I hope you found his special gun, otherwise you may want to go back and look a bit closer. However it requires a holy cross to perform an exorcism, we have been running low on those, but there may have been one with the book.",
"The book of exorcism is of little or no use to you but invaluable to the church. Would you be prepared to exchange it for a quantity of root we know as St Thomas's lidpod?",
"Yes I would although I have no idea what that is but it can't be as useless to me as the book.",
"Maybe there was, I do happen to have one on me.",
"Maybe but I haven't got one, perhaps I could find you one though.",
"Maybe but I haven't got one, so there's just the book.",
"Thank you so much, this could really save the life of people here. As special reward, you can have this item. I believe it relates to mister Winchester's gun.",
"Much obliged, it could prove useful.",
