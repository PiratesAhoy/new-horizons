"Why, all mates o' mine, dey be -- ev'ry bleedin' last one of dese scoundrels, ha! *burp*",
"Who governs you unruly lot?",
"Your ale-dispenser, barkeep, whatever you like to call him.",
"That gentleman who portends to repair seagoing vessels -- oh I'm sorry, are my words too big for ya?",
"He who sells the sails and, uh, stuff.",
"That weasely, wall-eyed tinsmith outside of town.",
"The miss who governs the brothel...",
"Nevermind; no one's worth knowing about on this rock. But I'd like to know something else.",

"Very well. Another thing...",
"Thankee, that's all.",
"Isenbrandt? A stern bloke, that one. But he has what it takes to keep things in order here. Picked unanimous-like to lead us dogs.",
"I shall have to pay him a visit. But about another matter...",
"Thanks. So long.",

"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Good to hear. Cheerio.",
"Heh, I see where yer going with dis, matey -- follerin' yer bowspirit into a friendly port, like, eh? A little o' de ol' nudge-nudge, wink-wink, eh #smistah#? heh... Anyway, Celestine -- for that's de 'spectable mistruss's name -- keeps a fine stable o' pretty fillies, she do. Purdy and sassy.",

"Oi, I'd sell my ship, my dear mum AND my soul if I could only get a drink...",
"A fine set o' leaks brought me here -- who can set me up with a ship to fill the gaps?",
"Got a merchant here who AIN'T a cheat?",
"Can anyone on this wretched rock mend my bloody sword?",
"A fellow's got needs... if you catch my drift. Where might they be met?",
"Arne -- he's in dat hut out dere facin' de gates -- 'e's a jumpy, skittery buggah, an' he charges too much scratch, AN' he takes too long... Ah hell, #smistah#, bes' not t' bothah a'tall.",
"I'll take my chances, thankee.",
"And your poor excuse for a shipyard?",

"Ines' got a tankard waitin' for you on de near side o' de big rock what sits in de middle o' town.",
"Much obliged, my rude, smelly friend.",
"And where might I have my ship repaired?",
"Supposin' I want to deal in some com-PLETE-ly legal trade?",
"My blade's near to rusting away to naught... can somebody in this town patch it up?",
"Walkin' through de gates, de ship-fixer's hovel is on de rig-- no, de left. Port, eh? I always get dose two mixed up. No use a'tall for dose lan'lubberly terms, aye?",
"But more importantly -- where's your ale-house?",

"Where's your shipyard?",
"How about the tavern?",
"That's all I can stand of your company, thanks.",
"And what if I were to tell you my sword's not sharp enough to split open a ripe melon?",
"I'm not sure I follahs ye, #smistah#...",
"You know -- certain needs, that a #sgender# possesses from time to time... A #sgender# long at sea, with only the company of #spronoun3# mates, who, pretty as some may be, don't go a long way in quenching certain fires that burn in #spronoun3# loins?",
"Wot's dat? Burnin' loins? Ye needs t' visit de doktah den, matey... Ain't none here, 'zactly, doh.",
"Let me spell it out for you, MATE: Where do ye keep yer blasted whores?!",
"Me horse? Ain' gotta horse, #smistah#. I don't see what dat's got to do wit' burnin' loins, eh?",
"*sigh* Forget it... looks like it's back to #sonanism# for this lonely sailor.",
"By the by, cap'n, jes' between de two of us: 'S no ointment or hosses here, but ye might like t' drop by de brothel, far side o' de boulder, right beside our guv'nor's home. Dey host a mighty nice game o' dice dere. An' tell little Lucie a right hello for me, if'n ye would... *blush... belch*",
"*sigh*",
"Yassah, #smistah#? We be scallywags here, but we be mos'ly frien'ly -- up to a point. (A sharp and steely point, y'see.) Be right quick about it.",
"Right, anything you wanna know -- 'ceptin' where Ah keeps me stash, ho ho!",
"Really dat in'erested, eh? Mos' visitahs here jes' kinda cut an' run, if ye ken...",
"I'd like to know the history of the famous pirate island -- much storied, to be sure.",
"What's to be found on this desolate rock besides your village?",
"No, rather, another topic will do, shall we?",
"Aye, storied she is: a fine 'istory o' blood an' guts. But we freebootin', seafarin' folk -- calls ourselves 'Buccaneer Caribbeans', if it please ye -- take good care o' our own sort, and s'long as ye be flyin' the skull'n'bones, yer a mate of ours.",
"Fascinating... do oblige and tell me more.",
"Perfectly intruiging. But I've other things on my mind just now.",
"#sisland_Quebradas Costillas# be kept by de Spanish first, den many oddahs. We done stole dis rock from de Frenchies last, been some twenny years, and no one since be man enough t' try t' take 'er back. Jurcksen sees t' dat, he does! Gots all de govannahs shakin' in dere boots, ha ha!",
"Quite a story indeed. I'd like to know more about the present state of things, now.",
"Nope, 't'ain' nuttin' else t' be found here... Jes' our little buncha scallywags and scoundrels. An' be keerful who ye asks about whut, if ye takes me meanin', #smistah#.",
"Hmhm... duly noted. Anything more you know about your island?",
"Well... far side of de island, through some jungly-bits, ye just might stumble onta a nice surprise. But I keeps me mouf shut on it, mind ye.",
"How lovely. I should like to know more, if you'll bear with me.",
"Y'din't hear this from me, matey, but... Quite a purdy mansion, dere is, jes' trew a spot o' jungle yondah. Been nigh empty dese many years, e'en full o' swag as she is, but we all be a'feared t' touch it, 'lessen the rightful ownah come back -- a right fearful one 'e is, we all knows.",
"Oh yeah?",
"You've been unexpectedly, but delightfully, helpful. Could you answer me another one, mate?",
"** shudder ** Doze red-robed devils kilt me bruddah widdout sayin' a word.",
"It was your brother they killed?",
"Aye. Me bruddah got mixed up with dem after he did some favahs fo' de priest at #sRedmond#.",
"I see. Is there anything else you can tell me about them?",
"Why you axx about dem, #smistah#? Dey mean nothin' but bad bidness.",
"There's some children missing, and all evidence seems to point to them.",
"Doze devils be bad bad bad, matey. You really goin' aftah dem?",
"There's money in it.",
"Dey kilt me bruthah, #smistah#. Ah hates dem worse den anyting, but Ah wouldn' go lookin' fo' dem fer all de gold in de Caribbean. But if ye be willin' t' die fer gold, matey, den go talk to #sFatherBernard# in the town of #sRedmond#. He not a good man eithah, but he might know where dose devils be.",
"Thank you.",
"Aye, Jakob Nickerson. Just moved into town not too long ago. He does a fair job fixin' boats, plus he has a score to sell.",
"Good. Something else?",
"I'm looking for a young girl...",
"Who isn't?",
"This is a girl that the pirates kidnapped.",
"What pirates?",
"Oh come on, you look like a very observant and clever young man. Maybe you have noticed a tall girl being taken as a hostage to this town?",
"Alright, I did see them bringing a new girl, a brunette, into the Settlement.",
"What happened to her, where can I find her?",
"Guess they sold her.",
"Like a slave? To whom?",
"Use your imagination traveller...",
"Okay mate, I can't spend all day talking to you. (Bad news - that would be the Brothel I guess!!)",
"I don't know nothing.",
"Maybe there is some gold if you have useful information.",
"How much gold are we talking about?",
"Well let's say 40, and that is only if you know anything of value for me.",
"You seem very eager Captain, why not make it 60?",
"Greedy pirate? I'll give you 50 even though it's far too much.",
"It's 30 or nothing, you pathetic little thief!",
"Take your gold then and start talking or I'll...",
"If you know anything - spit it out or I'll hurt you badly!",
"Do I have to repeat it Captain, I don't know what you're talking about!",
"I'm not afraid of you youngster!",
"Get out of my sight now.",
"Hand 'em over Captain.",
