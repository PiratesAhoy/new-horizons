"Hello, friend.",
"What's new in town?",
"We were about to discuss yesterday's excitement over another pint. Why don't you have a seat and we'll share it with you.",
"All right.",
"Yesterday, I captured a man who had decided to fight one of the town's guards. A cannoneer I believe. Could've really hurt someone if he had been the least bit sober. Now he's in the town jail.",
"What was his name?",
"Edgar Attwood.",
"Shiver me timbers! That's my cannoneer!",
"If you'd like help retrieving him, Martin and me are ready to help. Give us 1000 gold each and we'll arrange an escape with the jail guard. We'll stage a fight with you to create a distraction, so you'll be able to take Edgar and slip away. Wait for us in port around six o'clock.",
"Deal. I appreciate your help. Let's toast to success!",
"No, I'm not ready to commit a crime for Edgar's sake. Thanks for the company and farewell.",
"Hiccup! Time to go home! Bye, captain!",
"...",
" And remember, you just whack us all a few times and we'll lie down nice and dead-like, and you can make off with your mate.",
