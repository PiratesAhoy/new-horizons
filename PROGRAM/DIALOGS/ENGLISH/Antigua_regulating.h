"Don't waste my and your time, Sir, we don't deal with civilians here. The only exception are loyal privateers with a Letter of Marquee.",
"Couldn't I prove my loyalty and commitment to the war effort with a.. err.. financial contribution to you.. err.. I mean the Crown's warchest? Let's say.. ",
" Gold? Don't bother with a receipt, I trust that you won't keep single a coin for yourself..(WINK)",
"But I HAVE a Letter of Marquee..",
"Hey, don't you know me anymore? I paid you already before..",
"Actually I was looking for the portadmiral.",
"My, my, you seem to be a very busy and important man. What exactly is your job.. err.. duty?",
"Too bad.. Well, looks like I'll have to hire some scum from the outskirts. Farewell, brasshead.",
"As Regulating Captain of the Impress Service I inspect all recruits and make sure that the impressment of sailors for naval service is performed according to the rules. I know that many people think that impressment is nothing but hijacking. But actually it is a crude form of conscription, and there is simply no other way to man our ships. So impressment is an evil neccessary for the survival of our nation. I try to curb the excesses and abuses, which is no easy job.",
"Can I motivate YOU if I jingle with ",
" Gold? For a charitable cause, of course, to support the wives of the sailors you press. I trust that you won't keep single a coin for yourself (WINK)",
"You, Sir, are nothing but an imposter! Your relation to the Crown is certainly NOT good enough for a Letter of Marquee. Master at Arms, arrest this cheat!",
"You are just too well informed about my RELATIONS.. Well, people who know too much must be killed. Maybe your successor will be less nosy..",
"Really? Well, who cares, it's only a scrap of paper anyway. Still, there are simply no proper sailors availlable, but there maybe a way to solve your problem, and a problem of MINE as well: a shipload of convicts from Europe has just arrived, and instead of distributing them among the fleet, where they will probably only spread goalfever and mutinous ideas, I could rid myself of the whole horde by sending them to your ship.",
"Hmm.. I really need men. Send them over, I'll soon turn them into proper sailors.",
"Oh no, thank you. I'd better not spoil the morale of my crew by mixing them with undisciplined landlubbers. Goodbye.",
"Ah, I see. Still, there are simply no proper sailors availlable, but there maybe a way to solve your problem, and a problem of MINE as well: a shipload of convicts from Europe has just arrived, and instead of distributing them among the fleet, where they will probably only spread goalfever and mutinous ideas, I could rid myself of the whole horde by sending them to your ship.",
"Hmm.. I really need men. Send them over, I'll soon turn them into proper sailors.",
"His Lordship the portadmiral is in his office upstairs. But be careful that you don't take the wrong door, to the fort full of triggerhappy redcoats or the bedroom of the admiral's latest mistress. Both intrusions could be fatal for you.",
"Oh, thank you for the warning. Though I am certainly not afraid of those dumb redcoats. But an admiral's mistress.. Goodbye.",
"I flatly deny that, do you hear me, Sir? Cause that would have been an irregular procedure. We have never met before! DO YOU UNDERSTAND? (WINK)",
"Oh no, not with me! You just pretend that we haven't met before so that you can extort another bribe...",
"Ah, oh yes, I understand. (WINK) Must have confused you with another officer, small wonder.. those uniforms look all the same to me. A nice day to you, dear Sir.",
"Indiscreet idiots must be silenced.. ALARM!! THIS IS A SABOTEUR! HE HAS A BOMB, KILL HIM ON THE SPOT!!!",
"Those naval blockheads will hardly believe a privateer accusing their superior..",
"SHHH!! Dear Sir, be more discreet, I beg you! The Impress Service has already become suspicious of my.. Ah, never mind, but if you don't raise a fuss we can find a way to solve your problem, and a problem of MINE as well: a shipload of convicts from Europe has just arrived, and instead of distributing them among the fleet, where they will probably only spread goalfever and mutinous ideas, I could rid myself of the whole horde by sending them to your ship.",
"Swell! See, with the right arguments one can convince even naval blockheads..",
"Sir, are you trying to corrupt an officer of His Royal Majesty's proud Navy? My honour, not with me! Master at Arms, arrest this vile villain!",
"Hundreds of corrupt officials here, and I must meet the only righteous one.. Well, maybe your replacement will be more susceptible. Cause YOU will be sent home soon.. in a leadcoffin filled with rum!",
"Ah, thank you.. err.. in the name of the Crown! Now if that ain't a proof of your loyalty.. Still, there are simply no proper sailors availlable, but there maybe a way to solve your problem, and a problem of MINE as well: a shipload of convicts from Europe has just arrived, and instead of distributing them among the fleet, where they will probably only spread goalfever and mutinous ideas, I could rid myself of the whole horde by sending them to your ship.",
"Hmm.. I really need men. Send them over, I'll soon turn them into proper sailors.",
"Naval commanders are always desperate for sailors and send their own pressgangs out into the harbourtowns, in addition to the regular gangs of the Impress Service. And those shipgangs often press anyone they can get hold of, even landsmen, foreigners and sailors with exemptions. You see, the demand of sailors is so great that I can't spare a single man for a civilian ship. The only exception are privateers with a Letter of Marquee, cause the prizemoney that their crews get boosts the morale of our recruits. Many a poor young man has been lured into the navy by taverntales about fortunes made with captured enemyships. We actually send old sailors into taverns to boast about their naval victories. There is no greater motivator than the jingling of Spanish gold dubloons on a barcounter..",
