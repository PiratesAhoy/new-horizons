"?",
"Are you asking about someone specific?",
"Who exactly do you want to know about?",
"I mean the governor.",
"I am interested in the owner of the tavern.",
"The owner of the shipyard.",
"I'm talking about the local trader.",
"No one. Never mind.",
"Hmm... You know, he has recently come to our colony. He is young and enterprising, so he has made our colony prosperous.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"You know, he is a nice man, He's got a sense of humor, and his tavern is clean. Most important - he always keeps the peace in his tavern.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"I don't really know him well. They say that he is a dull fellow. At least, no one ever sees him in the tavern. Somebody said that he is dreaming to build some magnificently large ship.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"He is very greedy. Some say that he was Baldewin Coffier's assistant, but when the store went bust, he bought it for a low price. I don't know about the quality or price of his goods, but he doesn't seem to be a very...good person.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"Where are you headed, ",
"?",
"Not a problem, captain. Where do you need to be?",
"I'm happy to guide you, ",
". But where do you want to go?",
"How can I get to the tavern?",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell the goods I've brought with me?",
"Is this une esprit, capitan? Can't ü see le sign on the right?",
"Fine. Thanks for your time.",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"Right after le landing-bridge go right and just head for the house at the end.",
"I see. And the tavern?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"I think that's everything. Thanks for your help.",
"You alle left after le landing-bridge, to the side of the big left house.",
"Where can I find the local shipyard?",
"How do I get to the tavern?",
"I see. Thanks for the information.",
"I'm not sure why you'd be interested, but why not?",
"What exactly are you interested in, ",
"?",
"Of course, ",
". Fortunately, it's a fairly short story.",
"I'm interested in the history of the colony...",
"Tell me about the colony.",
"Is there anything on the island besides the town?",
"I have a few more questions for you, if you don't mind.",
"Well, our colony was established about 50 years ago, one of the first settlements in the archipelago. But the original colony was on the other side of the island; back then, natives lived where we stand now.\nSeveral months after it was established, the original settlement was destroyed by the Spanish. It was reconstructed here 10 years later.\nThe fort was built to protect the colony, and then it wasn't long before they sent us our governor.",
"Thanks. Let me ask you a few more questions.",
"You know, I really thought that was going to be more interesting. Let me ask you something else.",
"That's all I need. Thanks.",
"Thanks for your time. Farewell.",
"Not really. Other than a few plantations, the rest of the island is completely deserted.",
"What else can you tell me about the colony?",
"What else can you tell me?",
"There's nothing else to tell, really. Nothing here but the town. They tried building mines at one point, but it didn't work.",
"I see. What else?",
"No. You'll find a couple of plantations and houses on this part of the island, but it's largely undeveloped.",
"In that case, maybe you can tell me more about the colony.",
"Got it. Let me ask you something else.",
"Do you know a boatswain named Fred Bob?",
"What can you tell me about the harbormaster?",
"Oh, Fred Bob? He's not a mutineer, I'll tell you that! He's a good mariner, and a strong man to have on your side when you're outnumbered. Pity about his imprisonment. We all hope the governor will release him, because no one but that pompous first officer believes he is guilty.",
"Interesting. Oh, I have another question for you.",
"Thank you very much, farewell.",
"I don't know how he does it, but our harbormaster makes it his job to know of every mariner in the archipelago.",
"I see. One more question, if you don't mind, please?",
"Thank you for your time. Bye.",
"Fred Bob? The boatswain? He's awfully hard to understand, but my brother knows him well. He's not a mutineer. That officer has it all wrong. We all hope the governor sets him free. He belongs on a ship, not in the stockade.",
"Fine man, excellent mariner. I don't believe for one minute that he threatened mutiny.",
"Ehm... I plumb forgot who I was going to inquire of. Just give me a second and it'll come back to me...",
"How's that old metalworker Tomas fare these days?",
"You mean Tomasina, don'cha commandant gobeur? Ol' Tomas up and died not a while back, and it's his wife presidin' over the anvil now. Can't say she does a bad job of it, either.",
"Oh my... doesn't she come down with the vapours quite often in that profession? Nevermind; on to happier things.",
"Well. An elligible widow who can mend a blade? I shall have to pay my respects immediately...",
"My all-time best most favourite sword in the world here has gotten a bit dull as of late. To whom might I entrust it?",
"We don't have une blacksmith here.",
"Goddamnit! You can't be serious. Where the hell is a blacksmith for my hardly existent 'blade'?",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"To whom might I entrust my sword? Its once-fine edge has gotten a bit dulled.",
" We have a population of ",
" citizens.",
