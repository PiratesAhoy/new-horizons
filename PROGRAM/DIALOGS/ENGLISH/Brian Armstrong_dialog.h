"I need a job. Don't you know any rich boys on this island who are afraid to travel alone?",
"I don't have any questions at the moment. Let's talk about something else.",
"Maybe they have. There are many rumors around.",
"Hurry. I'm a busy man.",

"I don't want to help you. You've done caused too much trouble for my country",

"Your hands are covered in blood. You don't seriously think that anyone would travel with you, do you?",
"You are right, everyone's afraid of me! Ha-ha!",

"I'll do that.",

"Hmm, then I will wait.",
