"Hey, mate, you have something belongs to us. If you give us the chest all peaceable like, we won't even kill you.",
"What chest?",
"Why don't you peacefully disappear, lads?",
"The one you've brought here from #sOxbay#. Give it to us. It's ours!",
"Damn! I almost carried it to its destination point!",
"I don't like being threatened. And you won't get the chest.",
"If you insist on being stubborn, you'll lose your life! And don't think the soldiers will save you!",
"Now we'll see!",
"All right, take your chest and be off!",
"Ha! Well, I'm really sorry about that! And now shut your mouth and give us the chest!",
"I don't think so! Try to get it by force!",
"All right, take your chest and be off!",
"Ha-ha-ha! Your steel can't hurt us! Wanna try, brave heart?",
"Now, prepare to die!",
"What a surprise! Who could imagine you'd be smart enough to avoid a fight?",
"You got what you wanted - now get lost!",
"Yes, we are leaving. And I'll tell you one thing. That lad who asked you to deliver this chest set you up very badly! We could kill you, you know!",
"...",
"Well, now you see you can't beat us? I offer one last time - give us the chest. Or we'll kill you!",
"Never! Now I'll take care of you!",
"But that's impossible! I can't believe my own eyes!",
"I told you, you can't kill us! Relax, you'll get drunk and forget about this! Ha-ha! Now stop chattering and give us the chest!",
"Ah, to hell with you! Take it!",
"No, I'll kill you anyway!",
