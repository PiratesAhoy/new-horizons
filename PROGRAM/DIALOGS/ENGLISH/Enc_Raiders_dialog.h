"Stop! Drop your weapons! Stand and deliver, or die!",
"Hey, traveler! Slow down! We wanna take a look at your purse!",
"Halt, you! Pay the toll if you want to pass!",
"What is this nonsense?",
"What is it?",
"What do you mean?",
"Brigands! Well, crime must be punished. To arms!",
"I can't stomach common highwaymen, especially untidy ones. En garde!",
"I'll cut your heart out for your impudence!",
"Oh, #spronounsubj# doesn't get it! It's simple: You give us all your gold, and we let you live!",
"Haven't you heard of 'traveling expenses'? Well, that's us. Now part with your gold, or part with your head!",
"I'll translate for the stupid sailors: Give us all your money, matey! We love the doubloons and pieces of eight!",
"You mangy curs! I've got only ",
" gold.",
"I won't surrender my gold without a fight!",
"Hey, don't get excited! I was just kidding. Go on, now!",
"In that case, we've changed our minds. You can go.",
"You're a brave #sgender#, so we'll let you go! But don't let us catch you again.",
"Well, so long, then!",
"You should quit this foul business. You're not very good at it. Goodbye!",
"You've made a wise decision. Goodbye!",
"It's too late to back out now - you've got an appointment with your maker!",
"Turning coward, lads? But I can't let you go now!",
"I'm not going anywhere until I finish this.",
"All right. You had your chance. Now you'll die!",
"Okay, now you've made me mad. Die!",
"What?! We'll have your guts for garters!",
"Try it!",
"All right! Give 'em to me, and you can go!",
"Well, today it's enough to buy you your life. You can go.",
"Let me give you some free advice - if you're such a easy mark, you shouldn't be wandering around the jungle! Stay in the port and drink your rum. You'll live longer.",
"Blast you all!",
"You look to me like a richer #sgender# than that. But that's okay. When we're finished with you, we'll turn you upside down and see what shakes out!",
"Blast!",
"You again?! You should be running as if the devil's chasing you! Otherwise, we might change our minds about letting you go.",
"You've come to share more gold with us? How very kind of you!",
"I'll only say this once: get out of my sight before I cut you down!",
"Yes, yes! I'm just leaving.",
"I don't want any more trouble from you terrible ruffians - so I've decided to get rid of you!",
"What do you want from us? We let you go!",
"Leave us alone, #slad#. We've got our business; you've got yours. Let's leave well enough alone.",
"Get lost, #slad#! Do you really want to part with your money?",
"All right. I'm going.",

"Leave me alone!!! Get out!!! I want to live!!!",
"Help me!!! #spronounsubj# is a maniac!!! Don't kill me!!!",
"Spare me! I just modest robber! I am too young to die!",
"If you would sit at home - you would live longer!",
"Why do you waste your time and talents mugging pennyless travellers like me? You could earn much more gold by plundering fat merchantships. Join my privateer crew and you'll soon be swimming in the sea... eh.. in gold, I mean.",
"Bad luck for you, I've left all my money on my ship. You can get some of that, but only if you do me a favour in return: I desperately need planks for my ship, and I am willing to pay a premium price. Why don't you fell some of those trees for me? T'will be easier than felling me, cause trees hardly fight back.",
"Well, a cruise through the Caribbean would be a nice change from this feverinfested jungle. It's a deal, we'll join you, and I bet some of our.. eh.. colleagues will surely like to join as well.",
"The more the merrier. And now look lively, collect your dunnage and your.. eh.. colleagues and meet me at my ship, the ",
". See ya, mateys! (Well, with such scum aboard crewmorale is sure to plummet. But some drill and gold will fix that.)",
"What? Are you seriously suggesting that we spoil our reputation by doing honest work? Hmm... On the other hand, if you pay and promise to tell no one of our disgrace...",
"Let's pretend that you hack at trees only to practice axefencing. And now look lively, cut some wood and deliver it to my ship, the ",
". TIMMMBEEER, lumberjacks!",
"You are quite a tough guy. You know what, we will learn you a little trick if you let us go.",
"Well, that will save your skin this time.",
"I think this blade needs a little bit more practice and I just found a nice object to practice with.",
"But it will cost you",
"gold coins",
