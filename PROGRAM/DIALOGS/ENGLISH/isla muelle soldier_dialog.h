"Can't you see I'm on duty? Don't bother me!",
"All right, all right.",
"Did you want to report some crime?",
"No, of course. After all I'm a captain. I see you are not listening.",
"Remember -- we don't allow fighting on the streets! You can fight only if somebody attacks you.",
"Right. I'll consider that information.",
"Such weather, and I've got to stay here. You won't believe me, but the only form of entertainment I have is fighting with the flies that are trying to sit on my head.",
"Sorry, but I can't help you. It is your job, after all.",
"If you want to chat, find somebody else. I've got a job to do and can't talk to you.",
"I was just wondering whether you're alive or not. You're standing here like a statue.",
"DO you think it's easy to protect our city? Not at all! It's a very important and dangerous job. I remember once...",
"tell me some other time, I've got to go.",
"Move along, and stop bothering me.",
"As you say, soldier.",
"Hey! Won't you bring me a cup of rum from the tavern?",
"If I do that, they'll hang me up for turning a soldier into a drunkard! No...wait until you're off duty and than you can drink as much as you wish.",
"Why are just rude sailors like you are trying to talk to me?! Are there any beautiful women in this city?",
"You call this 'serving' the town? You can't even recognize a dangerous criminal...like me! Ha ha!",
"You look pretty healthy. Why don't you join our army? We've got a lot of room in our barracks, good food, rum for free...",
"Sounds good, but I'm afraid I've got to turn you down. I can't take the army's discipline.",
"This heat...I'd give all that I can to return to my lovely Spain.",
"Yes, this weather doesn't seem to agree with you.",
"You...*hic!*...you scurvy cur! You hurt my...*hic!*...my friend!",
"What friend? You're alone here, ",
".",
"What? He was...here a minute ago. I'll go find him. You...*hic!*...you wait here if you want your beating!",
"How dare you contradict me! I'm going to strangle you!",
"... ",
"Just a minute now, where do you think you're going so late?",
"I'm taking the brother here out to pick healing herbs.",
"Healing herbs? In the dark, ",
"?",
"He needs special mushrooms that only come out at night.",
"This is most unusual. Don't you know it's dangerous out there after dark?",
"Yes, it is dangerous out there, what with rabid monkeys and wild Akellani. We're armed, as you can see, but we'd feel so much safer if you would consent to escort us, protect us from harm.",
"Rabid monkeys? Escort? Ah... Ahhhh no, no ",
", I... I cannot leave my post. You may go, but remember, if you get killed, I warned you.",
"Errr, ahh, thanks. I'll try to remember.",.
