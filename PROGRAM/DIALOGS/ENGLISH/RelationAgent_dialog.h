"Hmm, what's your problem, ",
"? Who is after your head?",
"What?",
"Hello. Who are you?",
"I'm ",
". And I'm in need of your help.",
"Sorry, I'm mistaken.",
"So, you are in need of my help again?",
"That's the pirate life...",
"Thank goodness, no. Such help is too expensive.",
"Who have you run afoul of this time?",
"England.",
"Spain.",
"Portugal.",
"Holland.",
"France.",
"I just changed my mind.",
"So, who do you need to make peace with this time? Spaniards? French? English?",
"I'm afraid I don't understand.",
"Oh, I thought you were one of my customers. Perhaps you'd be interested in my services?",
"I don't know, what do you have to offer? I don't see any goods around.",
"I don't trade in goods per se. I help people settle their problems. You see, most of the locals lead less than honest lives and, are in need of help from time to time.",
"Such as?",
"Well.... Let's say, during your voyages, you partake of a few fat merchant ships. Before you know it, the whole Spanish fleet is after your head, and life becomes difficult. If you come to me, I can help restore relations between you and Spaniards.\nOf course, this service does not come easily, and for me to arrange such things can cost a considerable amount. But you'll be able to visit Spanish ports and towns and trade there again.",
"What guarantees do you provide that my 'relations' would be restored?",
"No guarantees. But feel free to ask those who use my services. I don't cheat my clients.",
"All right, I'd like to use your services.",
"That will cost ",
" gold.",
"Agreed.",
"Too much.",
"That will cost ",
" gold.",
"Agreed.",
"This is too much for me. Goodbye!",
"Deal. That will cost ",
" gold.",
"Agreed.",
"Too much.",
"That will cost ",
" gold.",
"Agreed.",
"Too much.",
"That will cost ",
" gold.",
"Agreed.",
"Too much.",
"Excuse me, you don't have enough gold. No deal.",
"Argh! Perhaps I'll return when I have more to offer.",
"You can set sail now. Everything will be settled as soon as possible.",
"Thank you. Take care.",
"That's not all.",
