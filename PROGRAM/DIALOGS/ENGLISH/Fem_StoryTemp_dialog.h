"Hey, captain! Is this your first time on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#?",
"Why do you care?",
"No, friend. Find yourself someone else to talk to.",
"Well, I could show you around...for a price.",
"How much?",
"No thanks. I can find my way.",
"I don't need gold, captain. But you might grant me a wish someday.",
"A wish? Are you sure your help is worthy of such a promise?",
"You're not making sense, lad. Go away.",
"Well, I know nearly everything about nearly everyone around here.\nIf you're looking to trade, I can get you a favorable price. And if you're after something more interesting, my contacts might prove useful.",
"All right. But if your wish offends my honor...",
"I can handle myself. You may go.",
"I've no desire to die young, captain. My wish has nothing to do with you personally. So... what brings you to #sQuebradas Costillas#?",
"I'm looking for a certain man.",
"Try asking about him at the tavern. If he's shown up around here,",
"Ines Diaz",
" should know something about him.",
"That advice doesn't seem worthy of the promise I made you.",
"Well, I can try to find something out about this man myself, if you're willing to tell me his name.",
"His name is ",
"Raoul Rheims",
". Get me some useful information about him, and you'll get your wish.",
"You don't need to know that.",
"It's a deal, ",
". And if you're headed for town, just go down this path and then turn right.",
"Thanks.",
"Fair enough, ",
". By the way, if you're headed for town, just go down this path and then turn right.",
"Thanks.",
"No, captain. We have nothing else to talk about.",
"I see.",
"Captain, wait! I've managed to learn something!",
"Really?",
"Raoul Rheims",
" has indeed been here! He put in to port for repairs, but then he sailed off again.",
"That's it? That's all you have for me?",
"No, that's not all. I happen to know where he was headed! He went to #sisland_Conceicao#. It seems he has some business with the chief of the smugglers there on that island.",
"Now, that's more like it! I'll head there immediately.",
"Don't forget about my wish, captain!",
"Of course! I always keep my word.",
