"Please leave. I have work to do.",
"...",
"But I need to speak with you.",
"Really? Well, speak up.",
"I want to know what you and the priest's assistant were talking about.",
"Tell me what you and the priest's assistant talked about...or else.",
"I am sorry. I don't know what you are talking about.",
"To be blunt, I believe you falsified several letters, and I want to know if it's true or not.",
"And what evidence do you have? Opinions are not facts. All those rumours about my past don't give you the right to accuse me now.",
"Calm yourself. Your past is none of my concern. I'm not judging you. I'm only interested in those letters.",
"Listen, you can tell me what I want to know in polite conversation, or at the tip of my sword. But you better tell me everything...or else.",
"And I already told you I don't know what you are talking about.",
"Perhaps I can make it worth your while?",
"Well, then perhaps I'll have to use more unpleasant methods of questioning.",
"You want to offer me money?",
"Yes, if you'll tell me whether it was you who wrote those letters or not. As soon as I know the truth, I'll leave, and you won't have any further problems.",
"Ah, but the truth is costly. Pay me 2000 gold, and then I'll tell you.",
"Perfect, here is your money.",
"That's exactly the answer I would expect from the one who wrote those letters.",
"I can tell you the truth for free. No, I didn't falsify those letters, and I had nothing to do with them. Now leave me alone.",
"All right.",
"You should have guessed I was involved after I agreed to take the money from you.",
"I wanted to make sure.",
"I admit that you outwitted me. Yes, it was me who wrote those letters, so I hope you don't have any more questions for me?",
"No, go on about your business, goodbye.",
"Your threats do not inspire me.",
"So, you're not going to tell me anything? Then it's time to make you talk.",
"Defend yourself!",
"Let's see what kind of fighter you are.",
"You again! I already told you what you wanted to know.",
"Yes, you told me you're in the business of producing documents. And this time I'm here on business. I'd like you to produce a document for me.",
"What sort of document do you need?",
"A pass to visit an inmate of #sPointe a Pitre# prison.",
"That shouldn't be too difficult. If you give me 5000 gold and three days, I can produce a copy so good even the governor would think he wrote it.\nOr, if you're short of money or time, I can create something right now for 500 gold.",
"I can afford both the time and money for the good one. Here's your 5000.",
"I'll take my chances with the cheap, quick one. Here's your 500.",
"I'm not interested in those prices. Goodbye.",
"Very well. Come back in three days and I'll have your pass ready.",
"As you wish. Give me a moment... That's it done. Just don't let anyone examine it too closely.",
"Here's your pass. It was certainly more pleasant doing business with you this time.",
"Thank you. Goodbye.",
"Your pass isn't ready yet. Come back later.",
"Goodbye.",
"Ah, it's you, ",
". Are you here on business again?",
"Yes, I need you to produce another document for me.",
"Papers showing me to be a newly commissioned kapitein in the garrison of #sDouwesen#.",
"#sDouwesen#? I used to live there. I am rather familiar with their military paperwork. Give me a day and I should have your commissioning papers ready. The price will be 3000 gold.",
"I can afford that. See you tomorrow.",
"I don't have that much right now, but I'll get it. And I'll be back to collect the papers when I have the money.",
"You are here to collect your papers, yes? Have you the money?",
"3000 gold, as you said.",
"And here are your papers, 'Kapitein' ",
"Your papers aren't ready yet. Try again tomorrow.",
