"Hey, you there! You look suspicious to me. Who the hell are you? Show me your papers!",
"Who the hell are YOU? Identify yourself, and be quick about it!",
"Halt! I have never seen you before, but you have the face of a pirate! Can you prove that you are none?",
"I am ",
" , and here are my comission and ship's papers to prove it. Was that quick enough for your rather short temper?",
"Oh, yes, of course, Sir! Here, my identification is in this purse, right below the 200 Gold. *WINK*",
"If you don't get lost at once I will show you how quick I am... with my blade!",
"Don't you dare to adress a superior in that manner again, you insolent hireling! Don't you know me? I am the Royal Inspector of His Majesty's Caribbean Regiments, and I have just arrived with the last ship to survey our troops here! Now don't molest me any longer, or you'll have to explain to your commander why I have missed my appointment with him!",
"Ah, yes, the picture on the coins identifies you as a #sgender# who has a heart for underpaid guards, hehe. Alright, I'll let you pass, but only this time. And behave!",
"Of course! Who do you think I am? A rogue? *WINK*",
"I don't trust you! ALARM! RAISE THE MILITIA!",
"Nice try, fella, but not with me! ALARM! A spy! Raise the Hue and Cry!",
"What's this? ALARM! A pirate!",
" Looks like my SKILLS were insufficient for THAT approach. Or was it just bad luck? Well,",
", I hope my fencing will be more successful than my playacting...",
"Oh, I see... Sorry for having bothered you, #ssir#, but we must be very vigilant here. The town is being besieged, and most soldiers are defending the ramparts. So law and order go to the dogs, spies and plunderers everywhere.. Why, almost every day some store or tavern is being robbed..",
"Well, now that we have made our acquaintance you could tell me a bit about this island.",
"You can surely tell me where I can get provisions for my ship.",
"With pleasure, #ssir#. #sisland_Saint Martin# is divided into a Dutch part around #sPhilipsburg# and a French part around #sMarigot#, and there is constant fighting between the two. \nSo if you try to get into or out of one of the towns you'll probably run into some battle, and the besiegers attack anyone who tries to cross the lines. To get through you must sneak carefully past their sentries and artillery positions. \nThough.. there must also be some secret passage into this town, cause sometimes Dutch raiding parties suddenly appear right in the middle of this town.",
"Raiding parties? Ummm.. that would explain why that mob over there wears Dutch uniforms..",
"Wha.. What? Where?",
" ALARM! THE DUTCH ARE IN TOWN!",
" To join or not to join the fight...",
"Sure, store, tavern and shipyard are all near the port. Apart from the port quarter the town has only some salt mines and salt works in the valley leading to the fort. \nAnd beware, there are lots of scum and cutthroats who try to exploit the strained situation of this besieged town.",
"Thanks for the warning, and can you tell me a bit about this island in general?",
