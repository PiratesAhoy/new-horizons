"Patrick Webster",
"Patrick Webster",
".",
"A trader named ",
"Dawg Bennett",
"Dawg Bennett",
".",
"Never mind. Sorry to bother you.",
"Alas, though our governor is really a good man, he lacks strong will. A more forceful governor would make our colony feel safer, and our merchants might trade in more profitable conditions. Besides that our fort needs repair.",
"I see. I've got another question, if you don't mind.",
"Thanks. Goodbye.",
"What can I say about him? He is little coward, and not so smart. Besides that he is very greedy! Though he always knows all the news.",
"I see. I've got another question, if you don't mind.",
"Thanks. Goodbye.",
"He is a good man, though they say he is much too harsh. They say he changes his workers frequently. But he really knows his ships.",

"Thanks. Goodbye.",
"Just tell me where you need to go, ",
".",

"Take the right-hand street of the two that begin at the harbor gate, and you'll soon see the tavern.",
"Thanks. Goodbye.",
"And where is the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell my goods?",
"The shipyard office is right in front of the harbor gate, ",
". You can't miss it.",
"Thanks. And how do I find the tavern?",
"Where can I sell my goods?",
"Thanks for the tip. That's all I needed.",

"Well, I don't know... What do you want to hear?",
"What in particular interests you, captain?",
"What would you like to know, ",
"?",
"Tell me about the colony's history.",
"Are there other towns on this island?",
"Do you know anything about the fort that protects the town?",
"Let me ask you something else.",
"You've come all this way just to learn local history? Well, all right. The colony was founded 54 years ago.\nThey found rich mineral deposits on the island, and the town gradually grew. We're doing quite well these days.",
"Please, continue.",
"Indeed. Let me ask you something else.",
"It's never been exactly peaceful around here. This land remembers more than its share of battles.",
"I see. Can I ask you something else?",
"I've heard rumors that some nobleman bought a house in the jungle, and nobody's seen this house, nor seen this nobleman.",
"Tell me more.",
"The entire island is covered with thick jungle. The shores are rocky, and there are many reefs. However, we do also have another town, #sEleuthera#, it's quite a bit larger and it has a fort.",
"I see. Tell me more.",
"There's not much more to tell other than #sEleuthera# which really is the main hub of the island. Jungle and rocks - just like all the other islands. Everything worthwhile is inside the town walls.",
"Continue...",
"I see. Let me ask you something else, if I may.",
"To be honest, captain, the only fort on the island is in #sEleuthera#.",
"Well, let me ask you another question, if you don't mind.",
"Ha-Ha! We have no fort here.",
"I see. Tell me more.",
"I'm not sure we should be talking any forts. What if you're a pirate, planning to attack it?",
"All right. Let's talk about something else, then.",
"I see. Let's try another subject, then.",
"Is there a banker in this town?",
"Why yes, that would be #susurer#, nice guy as far as I know.",
"And another thing, #ssir2#.",
"Um, that's all, folk.",
"I need to borrow and maybe store a little money, where should I go?",
"#susurer# owns the local bank, go see him.",
"Splendid. Tootloo.",
"And where is the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell my goods?",
"We have a population of",
"citizens.",
"? Eh, he's a reclusive man. Don't know much about him...",
