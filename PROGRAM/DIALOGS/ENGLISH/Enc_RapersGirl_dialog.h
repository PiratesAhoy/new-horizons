"Help! They're after me, please help!",
"#ssir#, you have to help me!",
"Please, friend, you must help me against these churls!",
"What's going on here?",
"What's this about?",
"What's the trouble?",
"These ale-soused stymphalists want to ravish me! I am not a porcelain doll, but I cannot take them all on by myself!",
"These fat-kidneyed hedge-pigs think with nothing but their smelly smocks! You have got to help teach them a lesson!",
"I was walking the beach, as I oft do, when these lily-livered trunks of humours waylaid me and my friends and got it in their onion-eyed heads that they would whip their bunglers out. I would help rid them of such ugly tumours, but I need your assistance!",
"Ah, I understand.",
"Ha, we really showed those swine! It is good to know there are good and valiant souls in this world still, #ssir#. Thank you verily for your help!",
"Three more sinners for the Serpent of Old! I'm very grateful for the help, #ssir#! One almost hopes we get to join swords again in the future.",
"Think to meet a knight in shining armor out here! Many thanks, #ssir#, I would not have managed on my own.",
"There's only one way to treat bilge rats like these.",
"I have only a little money. Please take it as a token of my gratitude.",
"Thank you. Remember to be more vigilant in the future.",
"I shall tell everyone that you helped me! They will know what a brave #sgentleman# and fierce fighter you are!",
"Thank you. Be careful in the future.",
"I have but a few coins. Please take them, it's the least I can do.",
"Thanks. Find me if there are ever more moldwarps that need the pointy end of a sword.",
"Don't be so nervous, friend! I was only joking. We're leaving.",
"Alright, alright! We've changed our minds. You're nothing but a washed up old hag anyway.",
"You're quite the hero, aren't you? Well, this time you may have won, but we'll be laying for you, you bloody bastard.",
"Now you've asked for it...",
"So you'd spoil our fun eh? Well, we'll spoil your giblets.",
"Good to see you've made the right choice. Now off with ye!",
"There's no turning back now. We'll meet ye next in the lake of fire, lad!",
"Afraid of us, matey? I'm afraid I can't let you leave alive!",
"I'm sorry but I can't help you, miss.",
"You could have left well enough alone, but now you'll pay with the price... in blood!",
"This is your own doing! Die!",
"So that's it, eh? We'll tear you to pieces! We'll cut out your liver and roast it over our campfire!",
"Try it!",
"Ha, you really showed those swine! It is good to know there are good and valiant souls in this world still, #ssir#. Thank you verily for your help!",
"Three more sinners for the Serpent of Old! I'm very grateful for the help, #ssir#! Though I am no killer, perhaps I shall learn from your brave example against such foulness.",
"Think to meet a knight in shining armor out here! Many thanks, #ssir#, I would not have managed on my own.",
"Damn your eyes!",
"You want us to surrender to your lily-livered arse? We'll tickle your ribs, we will. Money's easy enough to take from a corpse.",
"God's teeth!",
"You again? We let you off once. Now run along, lass, before we change our minds.",
"So you've found more gold in your pockets to share with us, eh? Wonderful! Har-har!",
"Now you've really raked my stern, #slad#! Get out of my sight before I poke your kidneys wi' me poniard!",
"Alright, I'm going! .",
"I've thought about it, and I'm back to give you what you deserve!",
"What do you want? Get out of here!",
"Get away from here! Leave us to our business! Don't come back!",
"Begone, ye bleedin' blighter! Or by gawd ye'll pay a dear price for yer peepin'.",
"I'm leavin' already, mates.",
"Your evil deeds can't go unpunished!",
"Get away from me! I want to live! Get out of here!",
"Help! #spronoun#'s a maniac! I don't want to die!",
"Spare me! I'm but a lowly filcher! I'm too young to die!",
"Ye'd live longer if ye'd sit at home on yer rocker, matey!",
