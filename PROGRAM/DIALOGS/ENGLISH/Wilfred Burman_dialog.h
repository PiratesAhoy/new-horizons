"I suppose you are his captain?",
"Yes. Why did you arrest him, was he drunk?",
"No he was not drunk, You don't know the rules of this island. These rules are to be obeyed by all and the penalties are harsh for those who do not.",
"What rules?",
"Almost all the island is a military area. You or your men are confined to the Port only, you were to have been advised of this before you took the mission.",
"But, I've got a free-pass.",
"I know you have. I already talked to Mister Blecher, the port administrator. But your stay is limited to the port, not going to the fort like your officer tried to do.",
"I'm really sorry, we didn't know all these restrictions. This mission was given only as the merchant was to sail and we were not briefed.",
"Um...Well, your officer is free to go with you now. Remember that the charge is espionage, penalty is death.",
"Espionage, Sir? because someone was strolling...",
"Exactly. I have been lenient only because this is your first trip to the island. You have been warned. Goodbye Captain!",
"I will inform my crew to stay in the port and only there. Thank you",
