"Begging your pardon #ssir#, but I'm thinking of retiring. I know it is a brave new world we have here with lots of room for enterprising individuals seeking excitement and souls with a taste for adventure, but what used to seem a simple life nowadays has me a bit uncertain of my bearings. Perhaps it's my old age taking its toll.",
"What do you mean by uncertain, #sname#? What seems to be the problem?",
"Will you just spit it out man! Just tell me what you're doing here in my cabin!",
"Sorry #sname#, THINGS MAY HAVE CHANGED, but there is no time to chew the fat about the old days. Life afloat may be more complex now, but the lookout reported a #senemy# battle fleet is on the way and I would hate to get in the middle of that. I know that there is a storm raging, and that we may end up far adrift or even shipwrecked. However I'll face that risk, and set sail right away. So if you're leaving, I wish you goodbye and good luck - I may see you again on my travels!",
"Erm... well... I mean... THINGS ARE NOT HOW THEY USED TO BE! There's much talk aboard about such things as who's at war with whom, where smuggling is being squeezed and such and how that affects us poor sailors' treatment wherever we go. Even honest Merchants, Privateers and the Navy all need to watch their step. Smuggling too is not as easy these days with many islands having better organised excise patrols. Makes me worry I won't live to see my retirement, Captain...",
"Nonsense, #sname#! Whilst it might seem confusing to the ignorant sailor, it is just a matter of knowing the international situation, understanding a common code of behaviour and how much you can bend either to your advantage. I'm sure I recently saw some books on Nation Relations and Smuggling that would help you understand how to prosper in the New World.",
"That may be so #ssir#, but we just follow your orders and take it that YOU know what you're doing. So as long as you keep abreast of the situation and know those books, I guess we'll be fine.",
"Hmm... just following orders is always a weak plea. Of course I expect you to follow them, that's why I am Captain. But you should try to understand why they are given. I'm sure you'll agree it's a great life if you know what you're about. You just can't sail these waters without running afoul of someone sooner or later eh, #sname#? ",
"Indeed not, Captain! And on top of the risk of falling foul of any nation and its allies or getting embroiled with smugglers, there are numerous other ways to run into trouble. So many desperate villains roam the streets of these Caribbean outposts and you can hire an assassin for a pint-o-rum. And don't expect any help from the corrupt colonial authorities. The town guards won't lift a finger to protect people like us. You've got to watch your back all the time, and you'd best take a bodyguard with you when on land.",
"It seems my adventure in the Caribbean is going to be more risky than I might have expected. I'll have to be careful until I've got my sea-legs and learned all about the way things operate in these parts. Is there anything else you need to tell me #sname#?",
"Well Captain! Yesterday you asked me to remind you of some things that you needed to do today.",
"Ah yes, very good. All right, go on then.",
"I remember everything just fine. Thanks.",
"Never mind all that, the lookout sighted #senemy# ships headed this way! We must leave port now, before we get caught up in an enemy action, raging storm or not!",
"First of all, take your personal equipment. Remember, you should always have your blade, pistol and spyglass with you. Who knows what can happen in these colonies.",
"After I came aboard, where did it all get stowed?",
"All your stuff is inside the big chest over there behind you.",
" Just come close to it and you'll see the 'Hand Icon' in the top left corner of the screen \nThis means you can do something there. When you see the icon, just press the 'Action' button.",
"I see.",
"If you use a box or a chest in this manner, you'll see an interface which will allow you to take items from the container or put them in it\nNow, go take your possessions, Captain, and talk to me again when you're done.",
"All right, hold on.",
"Haven't you forgotten something, Captain? It looks like you haven't taken all of your possessions yet.",
"Oh yes, how could I forget! Excuse me a moment.",
"Very good. Before we continue, we should take care of one important thing that could determine your survival during boardings. Every ship has a weapons-locker where arms used by boarding parties are stored, you will be able to find it in the 'Captain's Cabin'. This locker has a special symbol, a knife crossed with a pistol, but you access it like a normal chest. The better the weapons you put in there, the more successful your crew will be during deck melee.",
" Your crew will put all the weapons back after the boarding action, together with those which they take from defeated enemies. ",
"Your crew will take weapons with them so you must remember to replenish supplies in the weapons-locker frequently. ",
"When you're in the cabin of a captured ship you can inspect the weapons-locker there to find additional weapons.",
"By the way, Cap'n, I could teach you a bit about swordplay, if you'd like. Just ask me.",
"I guess I could use some training. Teach me.",
"I'm not interested in this, #sname#. Let's continue with today's schedule.",
"I'm getting tired of this. That's enough.",
"Great! Now you should equip your weapons and spyglass. To do that press the 'Character Screen' (f2) key and then select the 'Inventory' icon at the top right of the screen. Once you are inside your inventory, you will notice some categories at the bottom of the screen, 'Weapon', 'Medications', 'Items', 'Maps' and 'Quest-items'. To equip your sword click the 'Weapon' icon then look for your sword, then click on the 'equip' icon to equip it or 'release' icon to un-equip it. Do the same for your pistol.",
" When you're done click on the 'Items' icon and choose your spyglass and equip it. You may also use the 'quick-equip' key on your keyboard. Note that your blade should be equipped before your pistol. Also keep in mind that, not all items can be equipped. Now equip your sword, pistol and spyglass, then talk to me again.",
"Just a second...",
"You won't be able to defend yourself very well with your fists alone, Captain.",
"All right...",
"Hey, Cap'n, you forgot about your pistol. It should also be equipped.",
"Please excuse me, I am rather overwhelmed by all this new information!",
"I'll do it now.",
"Now, to help your boarders, put that bunch of ",
" in your weapons-locker.",
"OK.",
"I get the idea; you put them in there and let's get on with more important things.",
"It seems that you haven't equipped the weapons-locker yet, Captain.",
"Wait a minute...",
"No problem, Cap'n. Pay attention, please. In the bottom left corner you'll see your character icon. The red bar on the left is your health. The circles above the character icon show how many shots you have left in your pistol.",
"I understand.",
"Good. We need some space for our exercises. Follow me; when you approach the door you'll see the 'Open Lock' icon in top left corner of the screen. Press the 'Action' key to go to the next location.",
"Lead on.",
"Now, Captain, draw your sword with the 'Draw/Sheathe Sword' key. First you should get familiar with the controls, so I won't be attacking you. Use the 'Action' key to attack and the 'Fire Pistol' key to fire your pistol.",
"Let me try.",
"Just a second. To quickly gain some distance between you and the enemy, you can jump backwards by pressing the 'Dodge' key. Note that you can't talk to anyone with your weapon drawn. So before talking, sheathe your weapon by pressing the 'Draw/Sheathe Sword' key again.",
"I got it. Now let me try.",
"Well, are you sure that you understood everything so far?",
"Yes, and thank you for the instruction #sname#",
"No, I think I'll try it again.",
"I'm sick of all this instruction, lets get on with other things.",
"All right, that's enough, Captain. Are you ready for some real action?",
"Sure, bring it on!",
"Not yet. Let me practice some more.",
"No problem, Captain.",
"Thanks.",
"I'll fight back this time. Be careful, Cap'n, and don't forget that you can block incoming blows with the 'Block' key. If you rush into combat without thinking, you'll soon be feeding the vultures.",
"I got it. Let's start.",
"Not bad, Cap'n, not bad! Mind that if you've been wounded in a fight you can recover some health by using potions, bandages and other healing items. To do that you should press the 'Quick Command Menu' key and select the Use icon. Then press the 'Action' key, select the healing item from the list, and push the 'Action' key again.",
"I see. What's next?",
"I want to train some more. Let's fight again.",
"Enough of these lessons. You're dismissed.",
"Hmm... Looks like you need some more practice... Mind that if you've been wounded in a fight you can recover some health using potions, bandages and other healing items. To do that you should press the 'Quick Command Menu' key and select the Use icon. Then press the 'Action' key and select the healing item from the list, and push the 'Action' key again. Now, let's try it again.",
"If you say so. Let's start again.",
"I'll improve my skills later. What's next?",
"Enough of these confounded lessons. Dismissed.",
"Always ready, Cap'n!",
"Prepare yourself.",
"That's much better, Captain. Now I can let you go onshore without any worries.",
"What's next?",
"I still think I need some more practice.",
"Enough of these lessons. Dismissed.",
"Nah... I guess, it will take some more time to teach you proper fencing. Maybe you should spend a couple of days onboard taking training.",
"Can we try once more?",
"I'll get better later. What's next?",
"Fine. Before we leave our ship let me tell you about your skills and abilities. Since a skilled captain always has a better chance of survival in this cruel world, you should wisely evolve your character\nFor fighting enemies and completing quests, your character gains experience points. When you obtain enough experience, your character gets a new rank and additional skill and ability points. By using these points on different skills and abilities, you can improve various aspects of your character\nTo get all the information about your character press the 'Character Screen' (F2) key. There you'll see your character's rank, reputation, money, skills and hit points. Now you have some skill and ability points\nYou can distribute them right now or later.",
"How can I distribute Skill and Ability points?",
"Fine. Before we leave our ship let me tell you about your skills and abilities. Since a skilled captain always has a better chance of survival in this cruel world, you should wisely evolve your character\nFor fighting enemies and completing quests, your character gains experience points. When you obtain enough experience, your character gets a new rank and additional skill and ability points. While you'll have an option to decide what ability you'd like to improve, various skills will improve according to your actions.\nFor example, during swordplay your Melee skill will improve. When improvement reaches 100 percent, you'll gain one level up.\nTo get all the information about your character press the 'Character Screen' (F2) key. There you'll see your character's rank, reputation, money, abilities and hit points, as well as the percentage required for upgrading a given skill to the next level. Now you have one ability point\nYou can distribute it right now or later.",
"I'd like to know how to earn more skill points.",
"Can I get a description of the different skills?",
"Forget about those skill points, let's continue with something else.",
"If you want to do it now, open the 'Character Screen' (F2), then select the desired skill and press the 'Action' key to increase its value\nTo get an Ability you should select the Ability icon at the bottom of the screen and press the 'Action' key. Then you'll see a list of all the abilities. Select the one you wish to learn and press the 'Action' key again to read the ability description. To learn an Ability press the 'Action' key a third time\nSome abilities cannot be learned until you have learned their prerequisite ones.",
"I'll do that now.",
"Forget about those points, let's continue with something else.",
"Talk to me when you're finished and we will continue.",
"Sure. Which one is of interest for you?",
"Leadership.",
"Melee.",
"Sailing.",
"Accuracy.",
"Cannons.",
"Grappling.",
"Repair.",
"Defence.",
"Commerce.",
"Luck.",
"You can improve Leadership by talking with people in towns, completing quests and paying your crew regularly.",
"Thanks. What about the others?",
"That's enough. Tell me about something else.",
"To improve your Melee skill you obviously should practice with your blade a lot, just be careful not to injure innocent bystanders!",
"You'll improve your Sailing skill the more you actively sail your ship. Here storms and twisters can also help improve your experience, though those will surely damage your ship too.",
"By firing either your pistol or cannons you can gain points in Accuracy. Using a pistol is more effective.",
"Making progress in Cannons requires you to fight and hit other ships or forts during battles.",
"You'll get better in Grappling every time you throw a grappling hook.",
"Observe how the shipwright repairs your ships, and you'll get experience in Repair. When you start to repair your ship during sea battles, you'll also achieve the same effect.",
"Becoming a master of Defence requires experience of blocking during sword fights and repairing ships in the shipyard or during a sea battle.",
"If you often deal with merchants, you can quickly improve your skill in Commerce. When your Commerce is low traders will fleece you; when it's high you'll do that to them!",
"Luck will improve when you play card games in taverns. Also, you'll improve it when finishing quests and by talking with encountered people; but beware, Captain, when your Luck is low, some of them may try to steal your belongings.",
"Need some advice on how you should distribute your skill points? Put some in Melee Combat and some in Leadership to start with, or maybe Commerce for when we sell our cargo?\nBut there is no rush with that, you can always do it in your own time later as the need arises.",
"This skill allows you to control your people better. If you have a strong will, your crew will be less likely to surrender in a fight. Also seeing you so confident and strong, your enemies will be demoralized and may surrender sooner. This skill is very useful for a captain of a sailing ship in these waters.",
"I think I'll distribute my points now.",
"The damage you inflict in a fight with your blade depends on this skill. Also it affects the chance of piercing enemy blocks and successfully blocking enemy attacks.",
"This skill shows how good you are at sailing your vessel. If this skill is high, your ship will be faster and more agile under hand.",
"Good aiming can help you win a sea battle even against an overwhelming enemy. This skill represents how accurately your gunners can fire bombs and balls. Remember, firing manually from the deck always gives you better accuracy.",
"This skill is related to Accuracy and is also important for naval battles. The higher this skill, the quicker your crew reload the cannons, and the faster they will fire a salvo.",
"This skill is very useful for any pirate or privateer. It enables you to accurately throw boarding hooks to catch an enemy ship and try to take it with your boarding party.",
"This skill allows you to repair your ship on the open sea. The higher the skill, the higher the percentage of damage you can repair. Also, you'll need to have some planks and sailcloth onboard your ship to conduct any repair work.",
"Crew is the most fragile part of the ship and the most important. Without enough crew any ship becomes uncontrollable and awkward. Defence skill helps you protect your crew from enemy cannon fire. It also decreases losses of crew in sea battles.",
"The Commerce skill is essential for traders and merchants. With a high Commerce you get better prices in stores and sometimes you can even get a discount when hiring an officer.",
"Well, these islands are only half civilized. The authorities are still weak, and lots of adventurers and outright criminals come here to take advantage of that. So the streets and taverns are full of thieves, smugglers, gamblers and cutthroats, and you must be street-smart if you want to deal with those types and avoid pitfalls and traps. Whether you gamble, fight, smuggle or steal yourself, if you have high luck you'll be more successful, take less damage and reap higher gains!",
"Now I should remind you about that business we planned for today.",
"Go on.",
"Firstly, we have a cargo to sell, we should sell it at the local trader here, which shouldn't be too hard to find.\nAlso, our ship took some damage in that last storm and it needs to be repaired. The local shipyard should easily handle the repairs.\nNext, we need to hire some new crewmembers to replace those who were washed away by the storm. Talk to the local tavern keeper about hiring more crew, and remember you can always ask people for directions.",
"Is that all?",
"Almost. Your spyglass looks old and scratched, it won't give you the advantage you need in these dangerous waters, Cap'n. Maybe you could buy a new one? It should be available for sale somewhere in town.",
"And one more thing: our lookout reported that a #senemy# battle fleet is dangerously close. I'd advise we fly #senemy# colours when sailing from this port. You can change your flag by going into the 'Character Screen' (F2) and then the 'Relations' screen. By flying the #senemy# flag we can trick the #senemy# fleet and sneak past them, if luck is on our side!",
"Let's go.",
"If you want to buy a new spyglass you should be able to do it right now. Most places have street traders hawking their wares.",
"Fine, let's do it.",
"I can do it later. Let's continue with something else.",
"You can go. I'll find my way around.",
"We need to move to the town centre if we're to carry on our plan for the day. We must go to the entrance gates and then ahead through the next door to the other part of the town. Follow me to the gates and when you see the 'Open Lock' icon in top left corner of the screen, press the 'Action' key to go to the next location.",
"The pirate settlement is located far from shore, in the middle of the jungle. To get there, we must go behind those rocks, and then turn left near a hut. Later we should see the palisade. Approach the wooden gate after me and when you see the 'Open Lock' icon in top left corner of the screen, press the 'Action' key to go to the next location.",
"There isn't even one vendor on the island! Fortunately, I learned that we could buy a spyglass in the local store. We'll go there to sell our cargo, and see if they have a new spyglass.",
"As you wish, Captain. Follow me.",
"...",
"Street traders sell various goods and can normally be found at their stalls during the day. You should be able to buy a new spyglass. Talk to them and ask them what they have to offer. You will see 4 categories on top of the screen, 'Weapon', 'Medications', 'Items' and 'Maps'. In each category you will see a list of 'Items', just click the item you need, then choose how many you want and click 'OK' to make the purchase, then voila you'll be ready to go.",
"You've got it. Great. Now let's sell the goods we brought to the island.",
"All right. Where we can do that?",
"I'll do it myself. Return to the ship.",
"Hey, where is that new spyglass, Cap'n? I don't see it!",
"I'll buy it now.",
"I've decided not to buy it just now. Let's continue.",
"I'm going to continue alone #sname#.",
"As you say. Now let's sell the goods we brought to the island.",
"The local trade store is in the further district. I'll guide you there.",
"The local trade store should be inside the town walls. Follow me to the gates and when you see the 'Open Lock' icon in top left corner of the screen, press the 'Action' key to go to the next location.",
"I know where the store is, and you have some goods onboard that you should sell to get money to pay for ship repairs and crew replenishment. To see what goods you have onboard you should press the 'Character Screen' (F2) key and then select 'Cargo Hold'. Then choose a ship from those available to view. You'll see a list of goods that your ship has onboard. You can scroll it right or left. You can also see the amount of ammunition you have left on your ship.",
"Thanks for the info. Shall we go now?",
"I don't need your help anymore.",
"Follow me. I'll show you the right door and then you'll be on your own. But if you have any questions, just ask me.",
"Now you go talk to the merchant, Captain. Sell your ",
" and ",
" To get a spyglass, tell the merchant that you want to buy some personal gear and she should have one for sale. After that you should sell our cargo, which is ",
" but don't buy anything, we need money to fix up our ship and hire more crew. Do you need more details on trading?",
". We can use money acquired from trade to hire crew and repair the ship. Do you need more clarifications?",
"Yeah, that would be useful.",
"No, I can handle it.",
"It's very simple, Captain. Talk to the trader and tell him that you want to trade in cargo goods. Then select a ship that will be used for trading. After that you'll see a list of wares. Select a ware you want to sell or buy and press the 'Action' key. Then select the 'Buy' or 'Sell' button and choose the desired quantity that you wish to buy or sell. Then press the 'Action' key again to confirm the transaction.",
"Thanks for the explanation.",
"I'll wait for you outside the store. By the way, if you haven't assigned your skill points yet you can put them in your Commerce skill to get more profit from your transactions.",
"I'll wait for you outside the store. Remember dealing a lot with merchants will help you raise your 'Commerce' skill, giving you the opportunity to get a better deal with them.",
"All right, thanks.",
"You should sell all the goods you have. But that's all right for now, next I'll show you how you can hire crew for your ship. This can be done in a tavern.",
"Fine.",
"I'll find it myself. You're free to go.",
"Now that we have money we can go and hire some extra crew. For that, let's go to the tavern.",
"Follow me. I'll lead you to the tavern.",
"I'm right behind you.",
"Aye, Cap'n. Here you can hire crew. Also, sometimes you can find a good officer for your ship at a tavern, talk to people and maybe you'll get lucky. To recruit some new crew talk to the tavern keeper, he is standing at the bar, and ask him about crew replenishment. Then select a ship to assign the crew to, then select the 'Hire' button. After that, select how many sailors you want. Pay attention to crew Morale, though. Then press the 'Action' key to pay your gold and hire these seamen.",
"Sometimes it happens that there are no free crew on an island... That's unfortunate but you'll have to sail to another island to hire crew\nNow hire some crew. I'll wait for you outside.",
"I'll be there soon..",
"We're doing fine, Captain. All what we have to do now is to repair our ship. While you were hiring crew, I went and found the local shipyard.",
"Good. Let's go there.",
"I know where it is. You can return to the ship.",
"Excuse me, Cap'n, but you better hire as much crew as you can. Your ship should always be under your full control. But, since you can always do that later, we can go fix our ship now. I've found the local shipyard.",
"Aye-aye, Captain! Follow me.",
"Go.",
"We are now at the shipyard. Here you can repair your ship, upgrade her, sell her, or buy another one. Also, at a shipyard you can install different cannons on your ship. Do you want me to give you instructions on how to repair your ship?",
"Yes, tell me.",
"No, I can handle that.",
"All right. Talk to the shipwright and ask him to check your ship. Then choose a ship that needs to be repaired, you have only one right now. Then select 'Repair'. If you have enough money just press the 'Action' key after highlighting the 'Fix All' button, and your ship will be fully repaired\nIf not, then you'll have to select a percentage of hull and rigging to be repaired. Select Hull and then set the desired value. Then do the same with Sails. Then select 'Ok' and press the 'Action' key to confirm repairs.",
"Great, thanks.",
"Well, if so, I'll wait for you outside.",
"I guess that's all, Captain. I can give you some suggestions for what to do if you want, but now I must tell you something. I'm old, as my white beard proves, and tired of sailing. I'd like permission to leave your ship and retire here, well retire to the tavern that is! It was great to meet you Captain, but now my days are for drink and gambling. I'm sorry if that causes troubles for you.",
"I guess that's all, Cap'n. I can give you some suggestions for what to do if you want\nAll I dream about is spending my life in retirement, cruising the seas only for relaxation, and maybe a little personal profit, here and there. You see, I've been at sea since I was a young boy Cap'n, and now my beard is full grey and I'll be grateful if you let me take care of my future here, hang up my cat-o-nines and enjoy the local tavern!",
"Hmm... I can understand your reasons, I'll need a good first-mate to replace you, #sname#.",
"You'll find new officers for hire in the Tavern, and I'll be glad to help you with my advice anytime you'll be there.",
"Can you give me some suggestions about what to do next?",
"Tell me about sailing my ship.",
"Tell me about firing cannons.",
"Tell me about boarding enemy ships.",
"Tell me about paying my officers and crew.",
"Tell me about 'Direct Sailing'.",
"Tell me about crew 'Morale'.",
"Tell me about raising 'Flags'.",
"Thanks for your help, #sname#. Good-bye!",
" in the colony of ",
"Well, when I was at the store last, I noticed that they have pretty low prices for ",
". If I were you, I'd buy #sgood1# here and sail to ",
" - you can fetch a good price for it there.",
" You'll also get a hefty profit for ",
"Unfortunately I can't help you, Captain.",
"All right. But before you go, I should remind you what business you were going to attend to while on land.",
"Almost. Your spyglass is old and scratched. You should get yourself a new one. It should be available for sale somewhere in town.",
"And one more thing: our lookout reported that a #senemy# battle fleet is dangerously close. I'd advise you to use #senemy# colours when sailing from this port.", // KK
"...If you need my help again, I'll be in the local tavern.",
"Thanks. Farewell.",
"As you wish, Captain. I can give you some suggestions for what to do if you want, but now I must tell you something\nI'm old, as my white beard proves, and tired of sailing. I'd like permission to leave your ship and retire here, well retire to the tavern that is! It was great to meet you Captain, but now my days are for drink and gambling. I'm sorry if that causes troubles for you.",
"Can you give me some suggestions on what to do next?",
"Well, steering a ship is not as hard as it may seem. Ships move with the wind. The harder the wind blows, the faster the ship goes. You can set your sails in two positions; Full and Battle, or strike them altogether\nIn battle position, the ship becomes more manoeuvrable but maximum speed is decreased. With Full sails, your ship moves faster but turns slower. Always keep your eye on the wind, your ship won't go very fast if you're sailing against it.",
"Firing in Third-person Mode is simple, just keep enemies within firing range of your cannons and press the 'Firing' button when your cannons are loaded. Your cannoneers will automatically aim the cannons at your enemy\nBe aware that during the first person mode, you can use the 'manual' firing as well as the automatic firing but be careful if you use the 'manual' firing, regardless of if you aim at a friendly ship, or not, it will fire at it\nFiring manually from the deck is a bit tricky. You should aim your cannons at enemy ships, but not like you do with a pistol or a musket. Don't forget that cannons fire on ballistic trajectory and you must raise the aiming cursor higher if enemy is far from you\nOr lower it if the enemy is close. You can even do a direct fire, but only if your enemy is very close to you.",
"To board an enemy ship you should get very close to her. Your and her relative speeds also should be near the same unless you have the special ability or high Grappling skill\nThen you need to open the 'Quick Command Menu' and select the Boarding command. Then you'll have to cut your way through the enemy ship's decks with your crew, slashing and killing opposing sailors, looting as you go!\nAfter you win the boarding battle, you can plunder all the goods from that ship or take it with you if you have a proper officer to assign as a captain on the captured ship.",
"There are two ways to pay your crew. You can pay them by 'Salary' or by 'Signing Articles' with them. Be aware that some of your crew might desert if you have low leadership when switching between 'Salary' and 'Divide the Plunder'.",
"Tell me about paying 'Salary'.",
"Tell me about 'Signing Articles'.",
"If you are paying salary, on the 8th of the month the salary window will show up asking you if you want to pay your crew. If you choose not to pay, the crew's morale will go down. It will go down less if you have the 'Iron Will' perk. If the crew's morale gets low enough they will mutiny, and that's something you don't want. Morale will be more stable, but not as high as if you have signed articles.",
"For 'Signing Articles' with your crew and officers, you must be willing to divide your plunder. You may sign the article by using the 'Character Screen' (F2) then going to 'Ship' then clicking on the 'Crew' icon, you may also talk to any of your crew on board of your ship or to any 'Loan Shark' when on land. When you want to divide your plunder go back to the 'Loan Shark' and tell him you want to divide your plunder, then he will explain you what to do.\nBy doing so, you will have to divide your plunder to pay your crew and to keep them happy. By dividing your plunder you will be able to raise your Morale higher (than with the 'Salary' option) but it will be more difficult to keep control of. Say if you are greedy and make a lot of money and you don't share it with your crew, it will become more difficult for you to keep their Morale up; a too greedy captain always gets a rebellious crew.",
"'Direct Sailing' is simple if you got the correct gear and a good sense of orientation. The meaning of 'Direct Sailing' is that you can now sail from one island to another, while in '3D Sailing' view. No need to go back to the world map to sail from island to island anymore\nHowever using the world map will be quicker then '3D Sailing' BUT 'Direct Sailing' gives you the opportunity to enjoy the view as you sail directly from island to island. You may find some floating cargo or treasure along the way, or even encounter other ships\nWithout a compass it's hard to get your bearing unless you are an experienced old sailor like me.

"The 'Morale' of your crew is very important. With a high 'Morale' your crew will perform very well, with a low Morale your crew performance will be low and you will be subject to a possible 'Mutiny', if you let your 'Morale' sink too low\nThere are a few ways to keep your Morale up, by fighting and winning, keeping the status of your food and rum high, paying your crew with 'Salary' will give you a good average in 'Morale', 'Signing Articles' will increase your Morale higher then 'Salary' but is harder to keep that way\nYou can also increase Morale by doubling the rum rations. There's a chance of a drunken brawl then though!\nYour 'Morale' will go down if you refuse to pay your crew, losing too many fights, lower the food and rum ration, running out of food or rum during your voyage, hiring more crew at the tavern, having too much crew money on your person (best to put some in the ships weapons-locker) and taking on new crew from the capture of an enemy ship.",
"The flag can be useful when used correctly. It also represents different nations like; 'England', 'France', 'Holland', 'Spain', 'Portugal', 'Pirate' and your 'Personal Colours'(your flag). If you switch flag from one nation to another, it can be very useful. Say your enemy is 'France' and that you have to moor at a 'French Port', switching to the 'French' flag will help you sneak into that port without suspicion\nI recommend that if you raise another flag because you've got to enter a 'Hostile Port', do it before getting in sight of the 'Island'. You don't want the guards guarding the 'Town' or 'Fort' to spot you switching 'Flag', do you! Be aware of your 'Fame', the more famous you are, the harder it will be to sneak in. Being popular has it's good and bad side I guess\nYou can also pretend that you're a '#senemy#' vessel by sailing with the '#senemy#' flag and look out for a potential '#senemy#' target and once you get close to it, you then raise the appropriate 'Flag' and engage your enemy.",
