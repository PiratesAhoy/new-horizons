"What might one do for one?",
"Er, nothing. Sorry to bother you.",
"Captain. You're here before me, and ",
"Mateus Santos",
" is still alive and well. You disappoint one. Terribly!",
"Keep your shirt on, your big puffy frilly girly shirt...",
"Captain, what are you doing here? As far as one knows, ",
"Mateus Santos",
" is still alive.",
"Yes, well, the wind has changed, my friend, and the tide has turned. ",
"Mateus Santos",
" has made me a...more convincing offer. You may pray before you die, but make it quick. I'm a busy #sgender#.",
"Yes, and you misled me. The job turned out to be anything but simple. This ",
"Mateus Santos",
" it turns out, is no easy mark. In fact, he offered me good money in exchange for your lying hide.",
"Captain, might you spare one a moment? One has a task that requires a #sgender# of your unique abilities and...reputation.",
"I'm listening, but not for long...",
"If you know me by reputation then you are already aware that I do not suffer fools gladly.",
"As you will, But one never thought one would see the day when another would refuse good money for such a trifling endeavor.",
"How trifiling and how much money? You have my full attention.",
"Are you still talking? Enough already!",
"Oh, it is simplicity itself, if one has the stomach for it, and one suspects you do. There is a party who has been threatening one and one wants it to stop. One has heard that you are the sort of #sgender# who can convince people of almost anything.",
"One is halfway convinced already, but one would have to see the color of the other one's gold before one can muster up any real or lasting sense of conviction.",
"Oh, I get it now. A simple job, if you don't mind blood money. Sorry, but that's not my line of work. So long.",
"One would gladly pay you 1500 gold for this trivial service. It requires that you pay a call upon ",
"Mateus Santos",
"Mateus Santos",
" of #sIsla Muelle#. His house is next to the shipyard, just to the right. (Cough cough) Of course, if one's delicate health permitted, one would deal with this rascal one's self. It's said that he's a coward, a most devout coward, religious in it!",
"Your worship should trouble yourself no further on this matter. Where shall I meet you to report on the outcome of this task?",
"You must be joking. I don't take a breath for that kind of money. I've lived long enough to know better than to do an assassin's work.",
"One has been hiding, er, rather, staying on one's yacht, which one keep's near the shore on #sisland_Conceicao#, One will meet one ashore near the smugglers' camp.",
"One will find that one shouldn't have to wait very long to hear the news that one wants to hear.",
"Captain, I'm begging you - spare my life! The 1500 gold I promised you is all I have. Take it, but please don't kill one!",
"Sorry, friend. Business is business, and ",
"Mateus Santos",
" pays more.",
"Well...one has always have been a sucker for coin. Give one the money and go.",
"I don't want your gold, you fool. Just stop your blubbering and run before I change my mind!",
"It's nothing compared to one's life. Take it, and I'll go.",
"Just do it, and make it fast!",
"You pathetic fool. I can't believe you fell for that! You're too stupid to live!",
"You'd let me go, just like that? I...I... one can't believe it!",
"Try really hard. And do it somewhere else, before I change my mind.",
"Yes, it is too good to be true, isn't it? Perhaps that's because I lied. Say your prayers, and make them quick!",
"So that's truly the kind of #sgender# you are? Well, one may not be the finest swordsman, but you'll find a man fighting for his life is no small challenge. En garde!",
"I will kill you with a clear conscience, having given you a fair chance. That's more than you gave me when you set me up with Santos.",
