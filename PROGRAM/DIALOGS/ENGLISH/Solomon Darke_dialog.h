"Good day to you, friend! Allow me to introduce myself -- I am Solomon Darke, Magnificent Blade of the High Seas and swordsman extraordinaire! Ha ha! If that name's too long for you, you may call me Sol, if it pleases you.",
"Pleased to meet you. I am Nathaniel.",
"Why hello again, captain! You must've been so impressed by our confidence and skill you've no doubt reconsidered hiring us, right?",
"Certainly. Let's go. Welcome aboard!",
"Sadly for you, no. Goodbye.",
"Ah, a captain at last! Myself and my dear brother over there by the bar are both eager for work right now. I was hoping you would be willing to hire a pair of able officers...",
"Your brother? But he's... eh... well, you two don't look much alike to me.",
"I don't need any officers right now, sorry.",
"I take your point, captain -- let me explain. Will's my spiritual brother, a close friend. He's a great gunner, and so is quite a bit deaf, so I usually do the talking for the both of us. But believe me, he's as good with cannons as he is bad with words!",
"You seem able all right...at least your tongue does. I could sure use someone like you two... Come with me.",
"I see. Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't need any officers right now.",
"Well, if you decide that you do need two reliable professionals to keep your crew in line and terrify your enemies, we will be staying here for some time.",
"I'll keep that in mind. Goodbye.",
