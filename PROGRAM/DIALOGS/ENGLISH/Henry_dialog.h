", show a little charity to someone less fortunate than yourself. Please?",
"I'm sorry; I don't give handouts.",

"I won't give you a handout -- but I'll let you earn some money if you're willing.",
"Thank you, ",
"! Lady Luck will be with you in all your endeavours. See if she isn't!",
"Right. You've got your coin. Now, return the favour and answer a few questions for me.",

"I'm afraid I am nearly as poor in knowledge as I am in gold. But do ask your questions, ",
", and I'll do my best to answer.",
"Do you know the town very well?",

"You may be right. I shouldn't waste my time asking questions of a beggar.",

". These words are for you alone: the Governor is not a good person.",
"That's it? That's all you have for me? I'm going to need a refund.",

"I'm sorry, ",
". It appears you're a little bit short on funds right now.",

"Have you forgotten? I don't believe in handouts.",
"You again? Fine, take it.",
"I'll give you some money, but you'll answer some questions in exchange.",

"! Generosity suits you! May fortune always favor you!",
"By the way, I'd like to know something.",
"Thanks. You can go.",

"Alas, ",
", it appears you don't even have money to spare for charity.",
"(Return.)",
"Oh! I know him better than his own mother, I dare say! What exactly are you interested in, ",
"?",

"How much?",
"I'm listening.",
"Do you know the town?",
"What do you hear about the Governor of #sRedmond#?",
"I guess you're right. You couldn't possibly have the information I need.",
"Oh, yes, nothing like a bit of rum when the sailing's done. Go straight down the street from here. When you get to the square in front of the Governor's residence, you'll see the tavern to the left from it.",
"Got it. Thank you.",
"Where's the shipyard?",

"Please, ",
", try to understand the trouble I could be in if someone finds out I've told you something I shouldn't have.",
"All right, fine. Take your money and talk!",
"At that price, I think I can do without a beggar's secrets.",

". These words are for you alone: the Governor is not a good person.",
"That's it? That's all you have for me? I'm going to need a refund.",

"Oh ",
", show a little charity to someone less fortunate than yourself. Please?",
"I'm sorry; I don't give handouts.",
"Oh, it's you again. Here, take it.",
"Thank you, ",
". Your generosity is a bottomless well!",
"I'm hoping you can refresh my memory of a few things we've spoken about before.",
"Thanks. You can go now.",
"Can it be, ",
", that you don't even have money for charity? Perhaps you should join me in my, um, work. ",
"(Return.)",
"With pleasure, ",
". Ask me anything. Is this about the Governor?",
"No, it has nothing to do with the Governor. I'm just a little bit lost at the moment.",
"Exactly. What did you tell me about him?",
"I don't have any questions for you right now.",
"I'm sure it's entirely my fault you've forgotten. I tend to run off at the mouth. Come closer, ",
", so that I may speak in confidence.",
"I am all ears.",
"You're very nearly trembling with fear! Let's speak of something else.",
"Ah! No problem, ",
". Just tell your old friend Henry where you want to go, and I'll point you in the right direction like a fine Navy compass.",
"Where can I find the tavern?",
"I'm looking for #sRedmond#'s shipyard.",
"I've brought goods I'd like to sell. Where can I do that?",
"Thank you, ",
". How else may I be of service?",
"I need some directions. ",
"I don't need anything, thanks. Goodbye.",
"Ah, I get you! Nothing like a mug of rum to clear a sailor's mind after a long voyage. Go straight down the street from here. When you get to the square in front of the Governor's residence, you'll see the tavern on the left.",
"Got it. Thank you.",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell the fine goods I've brought with me?",
"The shipyard itself is behind the town's gates, at the shore. But the manager's office is, ",
", to the left from the gates. Can you see the sign, ",
"?",
"I see. And the tavern?",
"Where I can sell my goods?",
"I see. Thanks for your help.",
"Go by the central street ",
", and when you get to the square with a fountain, look to the right. You'll find what you need.",
"Where's the local shipyard?",
"How do I get to the tavern?",
"I see. That's all I wanted to know.",
"Remember, I told you the Governor was a greedy man who would stop at nothing to add to his fortune.",
"That's right. And what else?",
"Yes, I remember now. Thanks.",
"The Governor recently equipped a ship for a most unusual expedition. Rumor has it he's sent the vessel after some treasure he wants to lay his hands on.",
"Yes. It's all coming back to me. And I said that lots of fools go searching for treasure in these parts, and the Governor is likely another one.",
