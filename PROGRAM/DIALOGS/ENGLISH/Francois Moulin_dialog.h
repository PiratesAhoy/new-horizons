"What do you want?",
"Are you François Moulin?",
"Yes, how do you know me?",
"I've spoken to your daughter. She is quite worried about your sudden disappearance two weeks ago.",
"It's just a temporary situation. I am going to leave the island today on the 'Amsterdam', the ship that you see lying in the water there. Captain Pieter Boelen promised to take me to a safe island. I risk both my daughter's and my own life if I stay on this island any longer.",
"But what about your daughter? Are you just going to leave her forever without telling her what's going on? And why is it so dangerous for you to stay on this island anyway?",
"Of course I won't forget about my daughter. I'll send her a message when I get to a safe island. I must leave this place. I know too much. An officer, #sAntoineChamfort#, embezzles the money of the authorities and he'll kill anyone to keep that a secret.",
"So #sChamfort# is trying to kill you because you know too much? And now you also told me, so he'll probably be trying to do me in as well. It seems that I have no choice but to try and do something about that officer. How do you know of this anyway? And how can you be so sure he'll kill you?",
"My best friend, who worked in the fort, told me about it. A few days later he was found, murdered in his sleep. I'm sure #sAntoineChamfort# did that.",
"And you're afraid that #sChamfort# found out that your friend told you about his activities?",
"Exactly! #sChamfort# has spies everywhere. This island is not safe for me. I had wanted to leave before now, but Captain Boelen is the first captain willing to take a fugitive like me with him.",
"That's quite nice of him. But why did you not speak to the governor? I'm sure he would be quite interested to hear about an officer of his embezzling his money.",
"I haven't got any evidence. It would be sheer folly!",
"I see. But you shouldn't need to leave the island. I am going to speak to #sChamfort# and sort this all out. Where can I find him?",
"Be careful. He's a coward, but a dangerous coward. He'll never fight you in a fair fight. He'll either kill you in your sleep or attack you with a lot of other people to back him up.",
"So now he thinks he's safe with his soldier friends in the fort, right? How wrong he is! I am going to pay him a visit, soldiers or no soldiers. There's only one way to treat scum like that! Wait for me in the Buccaneer's camp.",
"There you are! I was beginning to get worried. How did it go?",
"You were right. I bluffed having evidence of his bribery and he then tried to kill me when I turned my back on him.",
"But you're still alive. Can I assume that #sChamfort# is dead then?",
"You can indeed safely assume that. Now follow me, we are going to inform Angelique. She's been worried for long enough now.",
"Thanks a lot for your help. Please accept this diamond and this old journal as thanks for your assistance. These were given to me by an old dying pirate during my stay at the Buccaneers camp. Please keep them in thanks of your help.",
"Thank you very much. But I have no use for an old journal. You keep it. Or give it to Captain Boelen for his help to you.",
"That is very friendly of you. Thanks a lot. Goodbye to you both. And be sure to give my regards to Captain Boelen.",
