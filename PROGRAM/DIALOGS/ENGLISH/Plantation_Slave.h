"I've got to work, you know!",
"Sorry.",
"If there's something wrong, speak to the master...",
"No, there isn't.",
"When will this day end!?",
"Soon enough, I'm sure...",
"Such unbearable weather...and I've got to toil away in it! Consider yourself the luckiest #sgender# alive!",
"Sorry, I can't help you. I'm not your boss, I'm afraid.",
"Can't talk now, I've got loads of work to do, and it's not my duty to interact with your kind....",
"Calm down, I'll leave you alone now...",
"Do you think it's easy to do this all day? Not at all! It is a pointless and unrewarding job. I'm fed up.",
"My friend, I'll try my best to help you, really... I will!",
"Go away! Don't bother me.",
"As you say, slave.",
"Hey! Will you bring me some rum?",
"I'm not allowed to help a slave worker whilst he's working. No, wait till you finish, if you ever do... And then you can have as much to drink as you want.",
"Aren't there any people who are willing to save me in this city?",
"Get on with your work. Look, you wouldn't want to miss impressing your owner, would you?",
"Are you going to help me?",
"You look quite fit. Join the army! You could even leave this hellhole!",
"This heat and humidity....! I'd give anything to return back home, to Africa.",
"I feel your pain.",
"What do you want?",
"I'm here for the coffee that you've been growing. Where can I collect it?",
"It's all in the barns towards the back of the fields. A lot of it there is too!",
"Thank you.",
"Our lives are tough. We aren't respected enough for the work that we do!",
"Well, you are slaves....",
"Will you join us, become one of us, and help us to escape!?",
"That's not a bad idea, I will help you!",
"Thank you #ssir# for killing the guards.",
"Get out of here, you're free!",
