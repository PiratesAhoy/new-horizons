"Did Skull send ye? If not, yer gonna look pretty funny trying to put yer brains back in yer head.",
"You kiss your mother with that mouth? Skull says stay away from his Snakebite stash.",
"So, Governor ",
"Robert Christopher Silehard",
" sends me his right-hand man. What does he want from me, boy?",
"Who says I work for him?",
"What makes you think I'm here on the governor's orders?",
"I beg your pardon, but do I look like the village idiot? The moment I learned someone was looking for me, I made inquiries\nWould you look me in the eye and deny you've been working for him for the past several months?",
"Okay, let's say you're right, and the governor sent me. What difference does that make? Would you refuse to talk to a representative of the governor?",
"Look, I've had about enough of this cat-and-mouse. Are you going to talk with me, or would you rather choose which of your legs you want to keep?",
"Captain, I wonder if you know who you're speaking to. You must trust me when I say that if I didn't want to talk to you, you would not be standing here.",
"Oh, there's no need for physical violence, boy. I'll speak with you because I'm curious: What does that old fox, the governor, want from me?",
"Fine. I need to know where I can find a gentleman by the name of ",
"Raoul Rheims",
". I know he's hiding somewhere on this island.",
"Your information is out of date, sonny. ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" did indeed spend a couple of days here, virtually never left his house, but he's already set sail again, and he kept his destination secret even from me. Clearly, he was worried about something, but I couldn't say what.",
"He has a house here? Where can I find it?",
"Has a shack here on the island, does he? Where is it?",
"Just a moment, boy. You may well be an envoy of the English governor, but that doesn't give you leave to invade another man's home and paw through his belongings. Do I make myself very clear?",
"I humbly request that you to make an exception for me, sir. I must find out where ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" was sailing to, and as soon as possible!",
"Oh, come now. You're a smuggler, known all over the archipelago for your lack of principles. You're going tell me about the law?",
"I can see you won't listen to reason. If I can't convince you to stay away from that house, I'll simply order my men to stand watch over it and shoot on sight. I'm sure even you can take a hint from a musket ball. Now, scram!",
"Goodbye.",
"This isn't over!",
"Lord Beckett",
