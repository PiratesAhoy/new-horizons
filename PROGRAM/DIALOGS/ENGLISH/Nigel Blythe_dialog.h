"What do you want?",
"You can see this fellow is not resisting. I won't let you kill an unarmed man. Drop your sword.",
"You're doing fine. Carry on.",
"Did you see what I did? With one strike...",
"Yeah. Impressive.",
"Did you see how I punished Artois? The scum told me he was a good navigator,\nbut that didn't stop him from sinking my ship and spoiling all my cargo. He won't be boasting anymore, will he?\nI'm a good captain - do you have a place for me on your ship?\nAsk everybody around here - they'll tell you that Blythe is the best pirate they know!",
"Sorry. Not interested.",
"You certainly know how to boast...but we'll see how you do in real action. If you're even half as good as you say, we'll get along fine.",
"You won't regret it! Now the only thing left to discuss out is my salary. I'm not going to work for free, you know.",
"How much do you want?",
"3000 gold, and my soul is yours.",
"Deal. Welcome to the crew.",
"Hmm. You rate yourself highly. I'll think about it.... Later.",
"Can I join your crew? I ask only 300 coins.",
"Sorry. My crew is full.",
"Sure. Here's your 300.",
"What are your orders, sir?",
"I'm listening.",
"Just having a look around.",
"Nothing.",
"Cap, it's you?! Good thing you came! I've just made us a deal that will make us rich!",
"What deal?",
"Good day, captain.",
"What? Why did you leave the ship?!",
"Well, I've got us a bet with the locals for 10000 gold that we'll manage to sink Mean Harry.",
"What are you talking about? You're at it again?!",
"What do you mean, cap? All right, the chocolate deal wasn't so sweet, but we're talking about 10000 here!",
"That's it. I'm sick of your crackpot schemes! You're fired!",
"Refuse this stupid bet. Right now. And I've had quite enough of your 'initiative' already!",
"Tell me more about this Harry.",
"It's all pretty easy, cap. We've got a month to sink the bastard. He should somewhere near here.",
"I said - tell me ABOUT HARRY!",
"Oh, come on, cap, don't make such a fuss. So, this Harry hasn't got any more than a piddling little ship...maybe a corvette or a frigate, I don't know for sure.\nAnd the local governor has offered 3000 gold for his head. We'll get another 10000 if we sink him within a month.",
"A frigate or a corvette?! Nigel, are completely out of your mind?! To hell with this bet!",
"Hmm. It's risky... but the reward is worth it. We can take this Harry.",
"I knew you'd buy that, cap! You'll see! You and I are going to do great things!",
"Dear me.... That last part of your statement is especially reassuring...",
"Oh, it's easy. We deliver this shipment of chocolate to #sIsla Muelle#, and we'll get paid a whole 2000 piasters!",
"What?! Who gave you the right to make deals in my name?",
"Relax. It's a great deal. I was a captain myself for a while, so I know how to negotiate.",
"That was your last stunt. You're fired.",
"All right, you've got half an hour to cancel the deal, and then get back to the ship. Is that CLEAR?!",
"You're lucky that I don't want to risk my reputation by canceling that deal. But if you do such a thing again, you'll be in serious trouble.",
"Relax, cap. Don't give me that look. I'll explain everything.",
"You better do that.",
"Thing is, that dirty pig whose ship I sank? He seriously screwed me over a few months ago.\nI couldn't just let him go after that, could I! I mean, the rat sold me spoiled goods!",
"Oh, God, Nigel, how many more disasters will you bring me?! That's it, you're fired!",
"Well, I think you've done the right thing.",
"We've done it, cap! That'll show em...",
"Shut up, Nigel. You're fired!",
"Yes, yes, but remember, this was your last trick! Understand? If you do it again, I'll skin you alive!",
"As you say, cap.",
"All right, get back to the ship.",
"We've got nothing to talk about.",
"...",
"You shouldn't say that, cap. I'm only looking out for our best interests...",
"Shut up! How many tons of chocolate must we haul?",
"Only 100 tons, cap.",
"Hmm. All right, we've got space for that. Now get back to the ship!",
"You're mad! Where am I going to put it, in my cabin?! You've got half an hour to cancel this deal!",
