"! This is treachery!",
"Dirty rat! How dare you attack a ship under the flag of ", 
"?! The same flag I saw on your own masts!", 
"You attacked a ship of your allies. The government of ", 
" will not ignore this act!",
"Our forces are weak. We have no other choice but to surrender. How do you intend to treat my crew and me, Captain?",
"We wait upon your nobility and kindness. What will you do with me and my crew, Captain?",
"Be prudent, ",
" will be sure to hunt you down.",
" gold from your trunk will serve me for my troubles, and your cargo hold is certainly not empty yet! Ha ha...",
"Flags... allies... treachery... aren't those words a bit too... overblown?",
"Tomorrow, I'll act in the service of another government. Your words do not concern me!",
"I have time to decide your fate. However, for now, I'd like to take ",
" gold from your trunk.",
"I'll cut you all down like pigs! That is my final decision!",
"Those who want to join me, I'll take as crewmembers. Others will be shut in my cargo hold while I decide their fate. The troublesome will serve as a forage for the sharks.",
"Cutthroats, my ",
" friends will not forgive you! You have incurred large troubles upon yourself.",
"My ",
" friends will certainly learn of this. They are REALLY dangerous people, Captain.",
"Let's be civilised about this, ",
"Do you want to live, Captain? Join me as one of my officers.",
"We can avoid unnecessary bloodshed if you voluntarily give me ",
" gold, while your crew lay down their arms.",
"Those of ",
" trusted me, and counted on my devotion. I'd rather die than put such a black mark on my name!",
"Foolishness - the most dangerous and expensive vice. This is your choice.",
"I don't think I have much of a choice, and no one is waiting for me on dry land. I used to serve ",
", but now I serve to you.",
"And what can you do as an officer?",
"Hmm... I dislike your sly tongue... I'll think about it.",
"Are you satisfied, Captain?",
"What do you think, Captain?",
"Would such an officer be good enough for you, Captain?",
"Maybe... Maybe... And how much do you want in return?",
"'Professionals' like you can be found for any amount in any port! I'm not interested.",
"What do you think about ",
"?",
"That is far too expensive for my taste. Think about your situation a bit.",
"I accept your terms. Welcome aboard. But remember this: if you betray me, not even Davy Jones himself will be able to lengthen your life.",
"I'll think about it.",
"Well, maybe you'll agree to ",
"All right, but for this price you had better be worth it!",
"I understand my position, Captain, but I'll lose my self-respect if I agree to a lesser price.",
"You won't regret your decision, Captain. I guarantee it.",
"I hope...",
"GOLD?! That's all you care about, Captain?",
"Those who want to join me, let's say ",
" men, I'll spare. All others, I'm afraid, will be left to their fates.",
"I hope...",
" gold?",
"I might let you and your men go...",
"All ",
" men can join me, if they wish. For you, I can offer you the position of officer aboard my ship.",
" But, what will become of my crew?",
" What will become of my crew?",
" Do you guarantee the lives of my crew and myself?",
"Be lenient, Captain. Here is your ",
" gold. I hope your word is worth it.",
"My word is harder than diamond. You are free... and, of course, your crew is as well. But I'll clean out a bit of your cargo hold first! Ha ha...",
"What are you talking about? Which word? I didn't promise you anything. Thanks for the money... and send my regards to Davy Jones!",
"Your sailors have been sent to Davy Jones' locker. You can join them, or join me.",
"Lying rat! I'll cut out your heart!",
"Better save yours...",
"I will repeat myself this one time only. Will you be my officer?",
"I respect that. Yet, I am not going to be soiled by such a #sgender# as you...",
"As you wish. Hang him, men!",
"Such pathetic last words.",
"Spare the crew, Captain! ",
" crew are not guilty of anything but being sailors. I'll accept your terms, if you let them live.",
"All right, all right... I'll let you go, and I'll leave your crew alive. But my crew will finish off loading first.",
"Would you serve as my officer? Your sailors will remain under your command. What say you?",
"Only ",
" men remained on my ship. What will you do with them?",
"No one remained on my ship. You are guilty of this!",
"Enough! ... Men! Lock 'em in the brig! I'll see to #spronoun3# fate later...",
"I don't know what to do with you and your crew. Do you want to be my officer?",
"Very attractive offer. Well... I agree.",
"I hope I won't regret this.",
"With your pathetic abilities?! Don't make me laugh. I prefer to be a free captain.",
"Your ship fell to my 'pathetic abilities'... it seems you are the 'pathetic' one here. Being a merciful #sgender#, I can offer you a position as an officer.",
"The Kraken awaits you...",
"I won't overrun my ship with cutthroats, and there won't be enough food for all the mouths.",
"You and your mad dogs deprived me more than half of crew. For you it means one thing... a short drop and a sudden stop.",
"I can't completely trust you yet. We'll see...",
"Your crew!? Please! They're my men already! And if you want to live, join me too.",
"Looks like there is no place for me in your squadron.",
"Maybe you'll serve as my officer?",
"Captain ",
", by your leave... It stinks of carrion here. Whether not from you?",
"That's Captain ",
" to you. And for your words I'll cut out your heart and feed it to the sharks.",
"Your jabber will not change your fate. En garde!!!",
"Baaahh... This is ",
". You are more like a filthy worm than a captain...",
"I will accept your crew of ",
"Thank you, Captain! They are a fine crew. What will you do with regards to me?",
"Maybe you'll serve as my officer?",
"I could let you go... for the right price.",
"Such a shame to bloody that really nice suit. But, I think I'm gonna have to kill you now.",
" Do you want to be my companion?",
", isn't it? Pathetic to call yourself a captain! I'll be delighted to slit your throat!",
"Thanks for your visit, ",
". I'd like to introduce you to my blade...",
"Captain! ... ",
", isn't it? Measly little bug! I'll be delighted to slit your throat!",
" How do you intend to act in regard to me and my crew, ",
". Bloodspill is not needed. Otherwise, those I serve in ",
"Sparrow. You are just the dirty pirate I knew you to be.",
"But I captured your ship now, didn't I?",
"Don't flatter yourself, pirate. I only ceased firing in order to avoid further damage to the 'Interceptor' and 'Dauntless'.",
"I think, if you review the situation, you will find that in fact, I just outmaneuvered you, Commodore.",
"Next time we meet I shall look forward to seeing you hang, and watch you maneuver on the end of a rope, Sparrow.",
"Ha Ha! In the mean you may remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow. For now you and your crew will repair to the 'Dauntless' and I will bid you good day, Commodore.",
"You, #ssir#, have killed my leader. For this you shall DIE!",
"So ",
", You have caught up with me at last. What are you going to do with me now?",
"Men! Lock him in the brig! I'll decide to give him back to England or to do something else with him later.",
"I am going to kill you. You traitor.",
"What can you offer me besides gold?",
"Well, I can teach you some tricks, perhaps. What do you want to learn?",
"I would like to learn how to turn my ship quickly.",
"I would like to learn how to reload my cannons faster.",
"I would like to learn how to board ships more easily.",
"I require you to surrender your weapons. You have my word that you will be treated properly.",
"Very well, as you are a ",
"respectable captain",
"naval officer bound by the Articles of War",
"privateer bound by the terms of your Letter of Marque",
", I offer my formal surrender. My ",
" and my ship are yours, #ssir#.",
"Much as I regret it, there is nothing I can do for them. I have neither space nor provisions for them aboard my ship.",
"Unfortunately I can only accommodate ",
" of your crew. The rest will have to be put in boats and left to fend for themselves.",
"Your sailors are being placed in a boat as we speak. You may join them... or join me.",
"Thank you, captain. On condition that you keep your word",
"That will be all for now. You will be taken aboard my ship. I will speak again with you later.",
"To the last will I grapple with thee. From hell's heart, I stab at thee. For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee!",
"My crew may have thrown down their weapons, the lily-livered scum! But I'll not surrender my ship to the likes of you, Captain ",
", without a fight!",
"To save further loss of life to both our crews, let us settle this in a duel, Captain ",
". If you accept, the winner takes both ships. If you refuse, it will be my pleasure to cut you down like a cowardly dog!",
"What? Who hauled down our colours? I gave no such order!",
"Do you really expect me to hand over my ",
" without a fight, Captain ",
"? To such a little vessel as yours?",
"Your crew have shown more sense than you. But if you want to die, so be it!",
"That is an honourable request, captain. I accept your challenge.",
"Have you such little control over your crew, captain? At least this saves me from making the mistake of hiring you as an officer!",
"No, captain. I expect you to die!",
"You're supposed to die after saying that!",
"I should have known you were a pirate!",
"We all live and learn. Except you. You won't live.",
"What is the meaning of this, Captain ",
"Isn't the meaning clear? I mean to take your ship. And your cargo. And your life.",
"Traitor! I'll see you in Hell!",
"Quite likely, but you'll be there before me.",
"You dishonourable bastard! this will not be forgotten!",
"Be quiet before i change my mind and have you killed instead!",
"My crew may have surrendered but they are still loyal to me! your men are outnumbered. EN GARDE!",
"It appears i have little choice, very well.",
"You'll have your crew do your dirtywork rather than fight me like a man?! Typical Pirate! You'll not get away with this!",
"ENOUGH! Stop your whining or ill make sure you die slow!",
"Why would i waste my time duelling you when i can have my crew kill you instead! BOYS! HAVE YOUR FUN!",
"Duel you? how about my men just throw you in the brig.",
