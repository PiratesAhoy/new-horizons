"What stories are the old sea dogs swapping over their rum these days?",
"What's the buzz in the taverns?",
"I'm looking for gossip, rumors, tall tales...anything I don't know may be of use.",
"Dish me up some of your freshest gossip, friend. There may be adventure or money to be found in even the smallest tidbit.",
"I still can't find...",
"It's impossible to find anything in this maze! Where is...",
"I'm as lost as a drunken navigator. Again!",
"You look like a local. Tell me where I can find...",
"Please tell me how to get to...",					//30
"I've had a rotten day, so you'll save us both grief if you'll just tell me how to find...",

"What can you tell me about...",
"Tell me whatever you can about one fellow...",
"I'm hoping you can tell me something about a person you may know.",
"This place isn't too big - I'll bet you know everyone who lives here. Let's talk.",
"Tell me about #sCartagena#.",
"What can you tell me about this god-forsaken place?",
"I'd like to know more about this fine colony.",
"What's the story of this city and the island?",
"Do you know anything of interest about #sCartagena#?",
"...",
"I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.",

"?",
"What interests you, captain?",
"What do you want from me?",
"Towns like this are always swimming with gossip. Give me the highlights.",	//50
"Has anything interesting happened around here lately?",
"I just want to know what's going on in the neighborhood. Someone's swindled a friend? Someone's been killed? The innkeeper's really a woman? You get my drift.",
"How can I get to...",
"Can you help me find my bearings here in town?",
"Where can I find...",
"Can you tell me about someone I'm interested in?",
"I'd like some information about one local fellow. Could you help?",

"?",

".",
"What's the talk of the town these days?",
"What stories are the old sea dogs swapping over their rum these days?",
"It's been a long time since I've set foot on these shores. What have I missed?",
"Could you give me some directions?",

"I've just realized I have to be somewhere. Goodbye.",
"Who do you mean,",
"?",
"Are you asking about someone specific?",
"Who exactly do you want to know about?",
"I mean the governor.",
"I am interested in the owner of the tavern.",
"The owner of the shipyard.",
"I'm talking about the local trader.",
"No one. Never mind.",
"He does his job, he does his job.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"Well what should I tell? He's a friendly guy, but that's called a 'job-requirement', isn't it?",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"He's surely the best shipbuilder in the whole archipelago. All Spanish military ships that were built in the Caribbean are constructed under his supervision.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"Well.. He came a few years ago with the Spanish armada to Cartagena, which wasn't cheap I think. He was already a rich store-owner in spain, and most people think he wants to enlarge his fortune here in the Caribbean.",
"I see. I have another question for you.",
"Thank you, bye-bye.",
"Where are you headed, ",
"?",
"Not a problem, captain. Where do you need to be?",
"I'm happy to guide you, ",
". But where do you want to go?",
"How can I get to the tavern?",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell the goods I've brought with me?",
"Hmm. Did you know that Cartagena has two taverns? I'll lead you to the tavern where most of the sailors are heading if they moor here, that'll be easier. When you enter the town, just go to the first main square, with the big residence. The tavern is the big house with the balcony, on the left. If you are interested, the other one is downtown in the corner next to the store.",
"Fine. Thanks for your time.",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"Head to downtown Cartagena, that is if you turn left at the main square with the residence and follow the stairs down. If you reached downtown, the shipyard is the big house on the left. The main door is usually locked, because it is the entrance for the Spanish marine-admirals. But the sidedoor should be open for private captains. ",
"I see. And the tavern?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"I think that's everything. Thanks for your help.",
"The store is downtown. You take the right way and follow it to the crossing. Turn right and you should stand in front of the store. ",
"Where can I find the local shipyard?",
"How do I get to the tavern?",
"I see. Thanks for the information.",
"I'm not sure why you'd be interested, but why not?",
"What exactly are you interested in, ",
"?",
"Of course, ",
". Fortunately, it's a fairly short story.",
"I'm interested in the history of the colony...",
"Tell me about the colony.",
"Is there anything on the island besides the town?",
"I have a few more questions for you, if you don't mind.",
"Cartagena is one of or maybe even the biggest town in the whole Caribbean. It was founded 1533 as one of the first Spanish towns on the mainland. Our town has a quick economic growth.",
"Thanks. Let me ask you a few more questions.",
"You know, I really thought that was going to be more interesting. Let me ask you something else.",
"That's all I need. Thanks.",
"Thanks for your time. Farewell.",
"Not really. Other than a few plantations, the rest of the island is completely deserted.",
"What else can you tell me about the colony?",
"What else can you tell me?",
"#sCartagena# is a port on the route of the Spanish armada, which trades weapons, horses and tools from Europe against gold and silver.",
"I see. What else?",
"No. You'll find a couple of plantations and houses on this part of the island, but it's largely undeveloped.",
"In that case, maybe you can tell me more about the colony.",
"Got it. Let me ask you something else.",
"Do you know a boatswain named Fred Bob?",
"What can you tell me about the harbormaster?",
"Oh, Fred Bob? He's not a mutineer, I'll tell you that! He's a good mariner, and a strong man to have on your side when you're outnumbered. Pity about his imprisonment. We all hope the governor will release him, because no one but that pompous first officer believes he is guilty.",
"Interesting. Oh, I have another question for you.",
"Thank you very much, farewell.",
"I don't know how he does it, but our harbormaster makes it his job to know of every mariner in the archipelago.",
"I see. One more question, if you don't mind, please?",
"Thank you for your time. Bye.",		//154
"Fred Bob? The boatswain? He's awfully hard to understand, but my brother knows him well. He's not a mutineer. That officer has it all wrong. We all hope the governor sets him free. He belongs on a ship, not in the stockade.",
"Fine man, excellent mariner. I don't believe for one minute that he threatened mutiny.",
"Ehm... I plumb forgot who I was going to inquire of. Just give me a second and it'll come back to me...",
"How's that old metalworker Tomas fare these days?",
"You mean Tomasina, don'cha commandant gobeur? Ol' Tomas up and died not a while back, and it's his wife presidin' over the anvil now. Can't say she does a bad job of it, either.",
"Oh my... doesn't she come down with the vapours quite often in that profession? Nevermind; on to happier things.",
"Well. An elligible widow who can mend a blade? I shall have to pay my respects immediately...",
"My all-time best most favourite sword in the world here has gotten a bit dull as of late. To whom might I entrust it?",
"Our Spanish blacksmith is downtown, on the right street. It's the house with the Spanish flag on the left.",
"Perfect! Seems I finally can polish my worn saber up!",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I get a decent price for fine goods I've brought to town?",
"To whom might I entrust my sword? Its once-fine edge has gotten a bit dulled.",
" We have a population of ",
" citizens.",
"I'm looking for a Monastary.",					//170
"We have three Monastaries here in Cartagena. Which one are you interested in?",	//171
"Uhh...ehrr.. which ones are there?",				//172
"There is the Cloister, the New Cloister and the Abbey.",	//173
"Please tell me more about them.",				//174
"In the Cloister is a very silent monk order. The New Cloister I'm not sure about but the Abbey I've heard, is for nuns.",	//175
"Yes! It's a nun I'm searching for. How do I get to the Abbey?",			//176
"From the Port take to the left. In the next part of the town take to the right.",	//177
"Okay. Port - left - right and there's the Abbey.",		//178
"Hmm not quite. First you'll find the Cloister...",		//179
"Yes..?",			//180
"The Abbey is found beyond the Cloister. You have to pass through it somewhow.",	//181
