"And what would that be? Your moth-eaten coat?",
"No, no, no - I've still got some loot left. Look here!",
"All right - let's see what you're hiding.",
"Well...I can't show you here. I've rented a room nearby, though. Let's go there.",
"No, thanks. Some other time.",

"Well, she is beautiful...",
"Too right, she is! But a game's a game.",
"All right. Let's play.",
"How dare you make such a wager?!",
"Ah, forget it! We play by the standard rules! 100 gold pieces a round!",

"Let's do it! I bet ",
"I'll back that up. Throw your dice.",
"I won't play.",
"Enough! I'm not playing with you anymore.",
"As you wish. I'll go find someone else to play with.",
"! I've seen better throws. Your turn.",
"! Not the best throw, but we'll see how you do.",
"! Not bad, not bad! You'll need to do better, though.",
"! I'm hot today!",
"Gimme the dice.",
"! ",
"You've lost, lad!",
"Take it. But I bet I'll win this time!",
"All right, you win. But I'm not playing anymore.",
"! ",
"You won! Dash it all! All right, one more time.",
"Try it, you won't win anyway.",
"Not this time.",

"Sure. Throw the dice.",
"No, I don't want to push my luck.",
"Now, this I like! So, will ya buy me a cup o' rum?",
"Certainly. Innkeeper! Rum!",
"You're a true friend! Cheers to us!",
"Whoa. Strong stuff!",
"To your health, and your generosity!",
"Cough-cough-cough.... That's smooth! Well, I've got to be moving on. See you around.",
"Let's have one more cup.",
"Twist my arm! Okay, why not?",
"Innkeeper! More rum!",
"You...you're trying to get me drunk and steal my money!",
"Settle down! I'm your friend, remember?",
"Shut up, rat, before I run you through!",
"Listen, you're a good #sgender#. Maybe you can help me with...a certain situation?",

"Huh? What? Where?",
"The thing is, you see, one of the soldiers insulted me...yeah!",
"Soldiers? No, no. I think I'll pass.",
"Insulted?! Where is he? Lead me to him!",
"You're not my friend! No! You want...to...you want to kill me! That's right - to kill me!",
"All right, I see you've had enough for today. So long!",
"What? I don't want to kill you! Stop saying that, or I'll cut your head off!",
"Help! Get him off me!",
"Relax, this won't hurt!",
"Argh! I'll butcher you like a pig!",
"We'll see about that!",
"You're so stubborn! Come here, or I'll complain to your master and you'll be out in the street!",
"You're drunk, you pig! You're lucky I don't want to get my hands dirty by teaching you a lesson!",
"What?! It's me who's going to throw you out!",
"Where did you get a sword? I'll show you!",
"The only thing you can show anyone is how to make a fool of yourself! Get up out of that chair, and we'll see if you can handle me!",
"I don't play for THAT little. Raise it.",
"What are we betting?",
"I changed my mind...",
"I've got ",
"! Hmm... Let's look at your cards...",
"... Surplus. Maybe next time. Let's try that again...",
"... Lady luck's a tart tonight. Let's play one more time...",
"... Open your cards...",
"... Lucky man. Give me the card...",
"... Hah! Surplus for you. Maybe you should cut down on the albatross?",
"What are we playing?",
"However...",
"If you always play like that I'd gladly go for a rematch! You like my purse, don't you coins? Yes you do! Haha!",
"You won't be so lucky next time.",
"You are great player. Cardsharp, maybe... I don't care... I'll be more careful with you in the future...",
"Ha! On mistakes we study... Good luck...",
"You are a good player. You have tenacious memory... With you - I'll meet with pleasure any time here.",
"Thanks for the game... Good luck.",
"So you are doubling up! Aye, give me a card and let's see if it brings you any luck!",
"Alas, I don't have enough money to double up",

"... Lucky girl. Give me the card..."
