"OOhhh... My head!",
"What happened? Do you feel good?",
"You're not a Spaniard?! Who are you? What are you doing on this island?",
"Don't worry! We are not Spaniards. We're looking for a mine. There would be silver on #sisland_Battle Rocks#.",
"You're right. How do you know this? The Spaniards make sure that this information remains secret.",
"It seems they failed. And you? Are you also looking for the mine?",
"This damned mine! It was the origin of my misfortune! I've almost lost my health there..",
"Could you explain better?",
"Well, the Spaniards found the mine two years ago. Of course, the mine belonged to the Indians before. After the discovery, the Spaniards deported dozens of prisoners from their colonies to work here as slave. Their fate is to die in this island. And believe me that some months of this life are enough to kill them.",
"So, you escaped from the Spaniards.",
"Indeed, last night. But they were not the only ones. I met a group of Indians a short time after and although I also succeeded in escaping from them, they lightly wounded me.",
"Humm...That might be the group we fought a short time ago. Could you take us to the mine?",
"Do you really want to go there? The mine is well-defended by a military camp. And you can expect to meet many soldiers.",
"Ok, I agree to take you there but on condition that you release my friends in the mine.",
"Of course, we would have done this anyway.",
"In this case, follow me!",
"Very odd! I expected more soldiers in the camp.",
"All the more reason to be careful. Tell me now where is the mine in order to release your friends.",
"It's near the camp. Follow me again!",
"Who are you! What are you doing here! Your name now!",
"My name is: GO TO HELL!",
"Hey! Konrad Kulczycki is back! Did you come to release us?",
"Right! Time for working in this mine is over. But I thought you were more...",
"And we are! However many of us have had to go with the soldiers to the port.",
"What port?",
"The port where the silver is loaded aboard the ships of course.",
"What?! There is a silver train under way the port?",
"Yes, they left the camp one hour ago.", 
"Now, I understand why we fought few soldiers. Well, you and your companions go to the shore on the East coast. I'm going to try to catch up with the train.",
"Wait Captain! I know a short cut through the jungle to reach the port. It's still possible to join them.",
"Excellent! Let's go now.",
"Thank God! Finally, we are free! I knew that Konrad Kulczycki would help us after escaping from the camp.",
"Indeed, your nightmare ends. Now, we need to leave this island. Any time more Spaniards can land.",
"Thank you for all! I will never forget what you did for me and my friends.",
"It was a pleasure. This gold will be a good start for a new career. See you Konrad Kulczycki!",
