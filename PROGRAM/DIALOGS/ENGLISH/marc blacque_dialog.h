"Marc Blacque",
"? I know a family with that name - they live in #sFalaise de Fleur#.",
"Your name seems very familiar to me, but I can't think why! I'm sorry I don't have time to find out more. Another time, perhaps.",
"You know them?! Are they doing all right?",
"So, you are related to them, then. I thought as much. Are you the son who disappeared several years ago?",
"Yes, that's me. But, please, ",
", tell me how they are.",
"I'm afraid I have bad news for you. Your sister has died, and your father went mad with grief when he lost you.",
"I'm afraid I have bad news for you. Your father went mad with grief when he lost you.",
"Rachel Blacque",
"?! No! How did it happen? Tell me the truth, please!",
"Your sister was killed by a port worker. As for your father, he's alive but at death's door.",
"How can this be? My family needs me badly, and I can't help them at all.",
"Why can't you help them now? Why have you let them believe you were lost all these years?",
"That's a very long story, ",
".",
"Sorry, I don't have time for long stories. Maybe I'll see you later.",
"I'm not going anywhere. Tell me your story.",
"Five years ago, I had my own merchant ship. It wasn't very big, just your average sloop, but I made pretty good money delivering goods throughout the archipelago. \nThen I ran into trouble - my ship fell into pirates' hands, and they sold me as a slave. I'd been working on the plantations for almost five years when I finally managed to escape...but they caught me. Those devils were going to lash me to death as an example to the others, but fortunately I was ransomed by Thomas O'Reily. \nNaturally, I couldn't send news to my relatives while I was enslaved. And ever since O'Reily freed me, there's been this war between England and France. \nSo, you can see why I haven't been able to get a note through to my family...",
"I can deliver your letter.",
"You can do better than a note. I can bring you to them.",
"You should learn to tell shorter stories. I've got to be going.",
"Oh, thank you very much! Take it, please - I wrote it as soon as Thomas bought me, and I've been hoping I could send it with someone.",
"All right, I'll give this letter to your family as soon as I'm back on #sFalaise de Fleur#.",
"Wait a second - what do I get for my kindness?",
"Tell my father I'm fine, and I'll ransom myself very soon and return to him.",
"Farewell.",
"I've only just been freed from years of slavery. I don't have any money at all!",
"Sorry to hear that. Goodbye.",
"No, of course you wouldn't. Give me your letter anyway - I'll deliver it for free.",
"You're very kind, ",
", but I can't go home until I repay my 3000-gold ransom to Thomas. \nSo far, I've saved only 500.",
"I'd help you out there if I could afford it. Maybe next time.",
"That's not a problem. I'll pay the rest of the money and bring you home.",
"Oh, thank you!",
"Don't thank me until I get you home in one piece. Now, tell me where I can find Thomas.",
"He's not hard to track down. He's the owner of the store here in town.",
"Good. Give me your 500 coins and wait for me here.",
", ",
". Did you talk with Thomas?",
"Not yet. I'll come back when I have.",
", ",
". Did you talk with Thomas?",
"I did. But, you know...he refused to let you go. Farewell...",
", ",
". Did you talk with Thomas?",
"Yes. You're free to go now. My ship is in port, ",
". I'll wait for you there.",
".",
"I gave the letter to your father. His spirits have improved miraculously.",
".",
"Not now - I'm very busy.",
"I can deliver the letter for you.",
"I can help you to return to your family.",
"Oh, thank you for your help, ",
"!",
"Thanks so much for your help, ",
"! God gave you a kind and generous heart.",
"Let me thank you, ",
", for what you did for me.",
"Don't mention it. I'm happy I could help.",
"Wait! What about the money I gave you?",
"Oh, yes - here it is. Take it.",
"What money?",
"I'm grateful to you for lifting this great weight from my heart.",
"You're welcome, of course. Farewell.",
"I can help you to return to your family.",
"Hey, did you forget?! I gave you 500 gold!",
"You must have me confused with someone else. So long!",
"Captain, I do have a request... I have need of a position if you are willing to take me on...",
"Your experience hasn't diminished your desire for the sea, then? Yes, I can offer you a position as officer.",
"Sorry Marc, I think you should stay here on land and look after your sister and father... They need a man around to protect them."
