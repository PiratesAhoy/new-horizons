string DLG_TEXT[13] = {
"Hello, sir.",
"Can I ask you a question? I'm looking for a man called Emilio Soares. Have you seen him?",
"Perhaps. Who are you?",
"I am ",
"and my friend here is Peter Blood.",
"Peter? He's Emilio's captain, isn't he?",
"So you do know Emilio!",
"Indeed, yes. I'm sorry for being so cautious. Emilio arrived here a couple of days ago after spending several weeks in the jungle, trying to find the city. He isn't very used to being on land.",
"So where is he now? Did he manage to find a ship to take him away from here?",
"No, he didn't. There aren't many ships that sail to #sRedmond# from here, considering that the Spanish are at war with the English. Emilio insisted on either finding a ship to #sRedmond# or staying here. He wouldn't accept a ship to another port. He usually resides at my house, but at the moment he's taking a stroll outside the city. It isn't prudent, considering he is being wanted by the authorities, but I couldn't stop him from going.",
"Thanks a lot for your help to us. And also a major thanks for helping Emilio.",
"I don't like the government much, so I'm happy for every opportunity to help pirates and smugglers alike.",
"That is very helpful of you. Thanks a lot.",
