"You disappoint me, captain ",
"! Who would've thought that such a decent and respected #sgender# as yourself would deal in contraband?",
"You're right, of course. I see the error of my ways, now.",
"You'll be worse than disappointed when I cut you down!",
"Well, considering the good things I've heard about you in the past, I'm willing to call this a first offense. Just stay away from such business in the future. As for these scoundrels, I'm taking them in right now!",
"Thank you, officer. You won't regret this!",
"Don't give me that - I'm not blind! You're under arrest, and your goods are confiscated!",
"Not without a fight!",
"Not at all...as long as you've got enough to go around. How much were you planning to give me?",

"Are you trying to bribe me? You'll find that my honor can't be bought! Come with us!",
"Sorry to disappoint you, but you're not going anywhere!",
"Ah, thank you for surrendering this.. eh.. piece of evidence to me. Thanks to your cooperation we can now arrest those smugglers.",
"What evi... Oh, yes, I see.. Yes, I lured those smugglers into a trap. Now do your part and arrest them! THREE CHEERS TO OUR HEROIC COASTGUARDS! ",
"But...but I must arrest you!",
"You're still here?! Are you so tired of living?",
"I...I'll report this. You won't get away with it!",
"Hmph!",
"You've gone too far! You'll die on this shore!",
"We'll just see about that!",
"Please look at this.",
"Very good, #ssir#. I'll have to take that to add to my own report, of course. Now, move along!",
"Thank you, now please go away quickly."
