"Hello, ",
". So, tell me about your sins.",

"Wonderful, then I hope you'll accept my gift to the Church.",
"Can I talk with you, #sFather#?",
"Thank you, #sFather#, but I must be going.",
"Is this concerning your faith?",
"Actually, it concerns your faith.",
"As a matter of fact, it concerns you.",
"I'm sorry, but I've gathered evidence that proves you've broken your vows as a priest.",
"No. And let's talk about something else.",
"What do you mean?",
"I was sent here to learn if rumors smearing your name were true.",
"Rumors? What rumors?",
"I guess you're pleading innocent. Unfortunately, I have letters that say you're guilty.",
"Really?! What letters? I swear I've done nothing!",
"Here they are. You might as well give up the act, #sFather#.",
"But I've never seen these before.",
"They're in your handwriting, #sFather#. And they show the full picture of your degradation.",
"I still don't know what you're talking about!",
"I'm talking about love letters you wrote to a certain young lady.",
"I swear to you I wrote no such letters! But dear God, who will believe me when they see these?!",
"Hmm. You're either a very good actor, #sFather#, or you really didn't write these letters. I'm glad it's not up to me to make that decision.",
"Don't despair, #sFather#. I can see now you're telling the truth. There's still hope.",
"Hope? My reputation is destroyed!",
"You know, I could simply 'lose' these letters.",
"What could I do to convince you to give them to me?",
"I think 2000 gold pieces might distract me enough to leave them here.",
"No! I won't bribe you with the Church's gold. Please, just leave.",
"As you wish.",
"All right. Here's your money.",
"And here are your letters.",
"Thank you. And now I'll go. And I'll take the letters with me.",
"What?! I thought we agreed!",

"What kind of rumors? I have no idea what you are talking about.",
"You're telling me that you're innocent of betraying your vows as a priest? And you don't know who would set such rumors in motion?",
"Good heavens, no! I have no idea of who would want to smear me like that.\nAsk anyone in town. Ask my assistant! They'll all tell you I've done nothing wrong.",
"Perhaps that's a good idea.",
"Well, all right. But I must say that such disregard won't do any good.",
"I realize it. Accept my gift to the Church.",
"I'm sorry, #sFather#, but I have to go.",
"Of course, my #schild#. How much do you want to give?",
"I am sorry, #sFather#, but I can't make a donation just now.",
"I'm afraid 100 gold pieces is all I can afford just now.",
"I should think the Lord would look kindly on 1000 gold pieces.",
"I'm doing well these days, so I'll give 5000 gold pieces.",
"It's your decision, my #schild#. It's never too late to change - and keep in mind that all will be taken into account at the time of your death.",
"My death is still a long way off, God willing! Let's talk about something else.",
"Sorry, #sFather#. I've got to go.",
