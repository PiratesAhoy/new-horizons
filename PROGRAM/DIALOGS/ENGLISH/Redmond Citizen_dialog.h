"Does this person have a name,",
"?",
"I'd like to know, ",
", who you are talking about.",
"Who has made you curious with their behavior,",
"? Even I become a little bit curious...",
"The governor.",
"The innkeeper, Charles Windem.",
"The owner of the shipyard, Murray.",
"The shopkeeper, Thomas O'Reily.",
"Nobody. Let's talk about it later.",
"Umm.... Nothing...can't say anything bad about him.",
"I see. I have a question.",
"Thank you, goodbye.",
"He inherited the tavern from his father. His father had a tavern not far from here, in another archipelago, on a small island named Highrock. Then his father came here, built a new tavern, and now his son runs it.",
"I see. I have a question.",
"Thank you, goodbye.",
"He was a convict in our colony, until it turned out that he has a talent for building ships. After two magnificent brigs were built under his direction at #sRedmond#'s shipyard, all his transgressions were forgiven, and he became a full member of our society.",
"I see. I have a question.",
"Thank you, goodbye.",
"Ah, nobody knows much about him. He moved here recently, and opened his shop right away. He seems to trade fair, and he doesn't dabble in contraband, either.",
"I see. I have a question.",
"Thank you, goodbye.",
"I have this town at my finger-tips.",
"It's not a problem, ",
". Where do you want to get to?",
"It's difficult to get lost in our town, ",
". But I'll help you with pleasure.",
"How can I find the tavern?",
"Where's the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell my goods?",
"Windem's tavern is on the main square, across the street from the governor's residence.",
"Thanks! Goodbye.",
"How can I find the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell my goods?",
"The office of the shipyard, ",
", is to the left of the town gates. There's a sign, ",
", so you'll see it right away...",
"I see. And how do I find the tavern?",
"Where can I sell my goods?",
"Thanks for the tip. Goodbye.",
"From the town gate, you need to take the central street, ",
", and when you reach the square, look to the right.\nThere you'll find what you need.",
"Where is the town's shipyard?",
"How can I get to the tavern?",
"I see. Goodbye.",
"I can't think of anything to tell you...",
"What exactly would you like to know?",
"Please.",
"I'd like to know more about the colony...",
"Is there anything on this island besides the town?",
"Do you know anything about the fort protecting the town?",
"Let's change the subject.",
"#sRedmond#'s history? Hmm... The colony was founded about twenty-five years ago.\nThe island is rich and fertile, and the colony grew quickly.\nNow it's the biggest and most thriving settlement in the whole archipelago.",
"More...",
"Sounds familiar. Let's talk about something else.",
"Naturally, a governor from the mainland was sent, and a powerful fort was built to protect the colony. It's all for the best - you can't trust pirates to mind their manners.",
"Let's talk about something else.",
"There's nothing more... except for a few desolate beaches and acres of jungle.\nThe jungle begins just outside the city, and a couple of paths have been cut, but there's no reason to venture there. Besides the wild beasts, there are also convicts and cutthroats hiding out there.",
"Scary! Tell me more.",
"Clearing the jungle is a hard work. That's why it's still a bit rough outside the town.\nBut the soil is fertile, and we have excellent crops. \nIn time I reckon the plantations will replace the jungle, and the town will be surrounded by farms, roads and fields.",
"More...",
"Hm.... There's a magnificent mountain range... jungle which is of no use to anyone.\n Desolate sand beaches...and that's it. The excitement is inside the town walls.",
"Tell me more.",
"I see. Let's talk about something else now.",
"I doubt I'd be able to tell you anything about it - I'm hardly interested in armies and wars.",
"Tell me something else.",
"Oh, the fort is a masterpiece! The treasury wasn't stingy in allocating funds for it.\nThey even brought an architect from Edinburgh to build it.\nThey say the power and might of this fort can be compared to forts back in Europe, and the number of troops it holds is more than 1000!",
"I see. Continue...",
"Hmm... I don't think I should tell you about it. What if you become a pirate?\nOur colony might be threatened just because I told you about some weaknesses in the fort.",
"You sound a bit paranoid. Oh well, it doesn't matter.",
"I'm tired of this conversation. I'd like to ask something else.",
"The guv'nor, right-o?", // NEW
"That much-fabled smithy of yours.",
"Ol' Mortimer thinks he's the greatest craftsman ever to wield a hammer and tongs, he does. But if'n ye ask me, the bloke charges too high and takes too long wieldin' 'em.",
"Fair enough. And now for something completely different:",
"Aha. Mmhm. Uhuh. I'm sorry, what was that again? Devils, I'm hungry...",
"I'm told you have quite a fine smithy on this island. Where can I find him?",
"Oh, a fine one he is indeed, captain. Though he charges a pretty penny, and given he has no lack of customers, you'll have to wait a few days for his work. You'll see his fires blazing near townhall -- same side of the street, just one door down, near the gates to the market district.",
"I shall bear that in mind. Good day.",
"How can I find the shipyard?",
"Where can I sell my goods?",
" We have a population of ",
" citizens.",
"At first, colony of #sRedmond# was founded by the Spanish, but in 1655 the settlement fell into good English hands: houses was built around strategically placed fort at the entrance of the bay. Those hands seized town from Spaniards, that's true, but wasn't strong enough to protect it against possible Spanish or French attack -- so governor relied on pirates 'help'...",
"Thus, for thirty years #sRedmond# was shelter for pirates and outlaws; the situation was so drastic that the town was referred as 'Sodom of the New World'. There were so many of buccaniers and other cutthroats because of location of #sisland_Redmond# in the Caribbean: the island laying in the centre of Spanish Main was very comfortable for attacking Spanish shipping and plundering towns controlled by Spain. That was the reason why famous pirate, Henry Morgan, had his base here and led attacks on Panama, Portobello and Maracaibo from this town.",
"But since 1687, when anti-piracy laws were laid down, the cutthroat-domination period is over, and now the colony is rich and prosperous, one of two most important British colonies in the West Indies.",
