"Hello Captain Pyle, I have got something that you're looking for ... ",
"Hello who are you, how do you know who I am and what I'm up to?",
"Lots of questions - but you'll need the medicine chest first. Welcome back again.",
"Alright I'll be back Miss ...",
"So there you are Captain Pyle. May these items help you get the citizens back!",
"What? How can you possibly know anything about ...?",
"I know everything, goodbye Captain Pyle.",
"---", 
"Please Captain - in here - quick!",
"Huh?",
"No, he can't - But I can!",
"Hmm? (Ok what am I thinking about now then?)",
"Oh stop that will you. There's no time for games.",
"(Isn't it!!!)",
"He's got more documents that could be of interest to you mister De Foe.",
"Oh sure here are some ancient scrolls and books. Please take them.",
"He's got a 'Woodes-Rogers' too!",
"Yes I got it from the governor!",
"Captain, add those pistols you took from the guards to that deal...",
"Alright, I didn't know you had an interest in weapons?",
"I have to make a living as a trader -",
"- is that so strange?",
"I see great danger for you Captain.",
"Oh yeah? (She can see the future as well!?)",
"I can see the future as well, yes.",
"Hrmm I see... (Scary that's what I think!)",
"You want those pirates out from there?",
"Indeed I do.",
"Very well. Mister De Foe -",
"- please give me the shipyard key.",
"Don't be so sure about that -",
"- I'll make it fit!",
"It was easy to find volunteers for an expedition like yours Miss Rogers! -",
"- I even got more men than we need, maybe they're something for Captain Pyle?",
"There was also a notebook, wasn't it?",
"Well, hmm... yes. Governor Rogers claims that this map belonged to Hornigold.",
"Maybe that was the kind of joke Teach was so fond of. If he was killed, the 'lucky' one to find his pistols would exactly know who he had to kill.",
"Let's assume Teach distributed six maps, regarding the pistols. So there could be five more maps to find...",
"Life is just an illusion...",
"Hmm, well ... ahh ... hmm?",
"The two first lines are the sailors",
"and the third line the officers.",
"Hello again Captain. You are wounded - what happened?",
"I was ambushed outside the shipyard. My officers were both killed. The bandits robbed me of almost everything.",
"Very clever. And Rogers' Golden Key you hided under the bandana.",
"How did you know that?",
"And now you're about to explore the entire Caribbean, in search for the other map-pieces?",	//46
"Very good, I'm on my way.",
"In the Sloop's cabin you'll find what you need for your journey, Captain.",
"Aha, you knew I was going to be robbed and have placed those items there already.",	//49
"...also of valuable metals. Those bars you might have taken for Lead or perhaps unclean Silver...",
"Yes...",
"It's nothing of that kind.",
"No..?",
"No, it's Platina!",
"---",
"........., Captain Pyle?",								//56
"Huh!? Who's there? Where are you?",
"Never mind, Captain. If you just follow my instructions there's a chance I can get you out of this.",
"I'll do anything you say to get my body back.",
"Very well. Close your eyes, relax and take a deep breathe...",		//60
"---",
"You are walking on an old path in a forest -",
"- the same path you have been walking so many times...",
"... and now you can slowly open your eyes -",
"- when you want.",
"I can take care of the wand, the censer and the drugs.",
"Sure, here.",
"Yes, and I have a lot of information. In fact so much, I've not decided where to sail first.",		//68
"Why don't you try the nearest port?",		//69
"That would be to Charles Vane.",		//70
"Yes and Cave Shore is on this island.",	//71
"Maybe you should study the book my friend sent you closely before deciding.",		//72
"Yes you're right, I'll do that right now!",		//73
"You lost the Marquis and the treasure.",		//74
"Well... yes.",		//75
"JRH, you know perfectly well that I can make any papers show up. You remember those pictures of relatives that you...",   //76		//76
"Please, say no more.",
"Very well, here are the tickets. Shall we go?",		//78
"Yes!",
