"Oh, Captain I am so unhappy ...",
"What can I do for you girl?",
"That is not a concern of mine!",
"You look like an honest and decent person Captain, would you like to help me out of here?",
"What's in it for me, if I do help you?",
"I'll get you a fine reward, don't worry...",
"How can I trust you - a simple hooker?",
"How can I trust you - a simple pirate, a murderer?",
"All right you've got a point there.",
"So you really want to get me out of here?",
"Maybe I am stupid but I'll try to!",			//10
"Oh I knew I could count on you Captain.",
"Help me Captain, and put an end to this hell.",
"No no they will overpower you in a moment.",
"I am not scared!",
"Of course you're not Captain, but let me lead the way out.",
"Where is that Mistress?",
"I have something that is every Gentleman of Fortune´s highest wish.",
"What is it?.",
"You wouldn't believe me.",
"Yes, please continue!",					//20
"Choose me and help me to escape from this prison.",
"Well, I don´t know...",
"Now what's this supposed to mean...?",
"Please Captain, talk to Mistress!",
"Calm down, I'll help you.",
"Yes girl we're leaving after I've killed the guards.",
"Ok let's say I believe you girl.",
"Why not just open the window?",
"The window is locked with strong bolts on the outside.",
"I'm listening...",					//30
"Let's sneak out and I'll try to open a window on the upper floor of the tavern room.",
"And I'm supposed to be the guard.",
"Yes and remember Captain, a fight is only the last alternative.",
"Exciting isn't it?",
"I can't open the window, please hurry Captain and help me!",
"It's no use, it seems to be locked.",
"Oh do something about it then...!!!",
"Get out when I've ''opened'' it, I'll cover you girl.", 
"Hurry Captain, jump to the next roof!",
"I'll follow you.",					//40
"Let's move on to the last house my Captain.",
"I have an better idea, this door must lead to the store. Maybe we can sneak silently down through the house and reach the gate.",
"No that would be a to long run.",
"Alright we do as you say, anyway - what's your name girl?",
"We don't have time for that now, my brave buccaneer.",
"Ok, let's jump again then.", 
"Uhh...",
"Please Captain come on, they could be here anytime!",
"No Captain, next roof is all too far away. It has to be the door!",
"(Like I told you...)",					//50
"Well My Pirate, try the backdoor then...by the way my name is Caroline K.",
"Nice to meet you Caroline. The counter looks locked to me.",
"Jump Captain Pyle, jump!",
"Fine, let's find a way out, or at least some booty.",
"Look Captain, there is a short rifle high on the wall above the shelves!",
"Yes Caroline, I'll get it.",
"What?",
"I didn't hear you jump...?",
"I opened the counter from the inside.",
"Hrmphh, nice pistols you have Caroline.",		//60
"Indeed they are, my father gave these Pocket Pistols to me when I was 12.",
"Strange gift to a little girl, your father is an exceptional man.",
"Yes he is a former Governor, Commander and Explorer.", 
"Ok, we have a very long jump now to the next roof Caroline!",
"Now that was close my Captain, we must move on.",
"If you're alright Caroline, let's run to the edge and jump for the shipyard roof.",
"Quick, in here Captain before you get wet.",
"WET? I can get wet??!! You almost killed me girl!",
"Sorry but the jump was too long (Like I told you)",
"...",							//70
"The gate is too far away for a run Captain.",
"Maybe we can hide in the storehouse, let's see if any of those windows could be opened.",
"It's true Captain, they were waiting for us, but I locked the door - hope it helps.",
"Fine, we have to figure out something else then...",
"Captain please, it's no idea, I can't jump that far as you noticed...",
"Hmm, let's find another way out then Caroline.",
"I'm fine thank you Captain. This roof is very high though - are you sure we survive this scary jump?",
"We have to take the risk. Fat monk you leave first!",
"Oh, my head! What happened Captain?",
"The roof fell down and so did we. Caroline, are you hurt?",//80
"Nothing broken, how do we get out of here?",
"The door is blocked but I have found some carpenter tools in the chests here that we may use.",
"Ok, let's try them!",
"There is one chest with two locks. I can't find both keys.",
"Have you searched the body of the shipyard owner?",
"Sure, I'm no fool!",
"They're going to recognize us immediately as the two 'monks' when we get outside. Let's change back to our own clothes.",
"But I've traded away my clothes for these two robes. I don't have anything underneath....",
"Why don't you take the clothes from that shipyard man!?",
"Yes, why not!?",					//90
"What? Did you find anything perhaps?",
"Yes actually I did. A big key.",
"No fool was it?",
"(Oh shut up)",
"Could you please try to open the door now!",
"Take it easy girl, I'm on my way",
"Nice work Captain! Before we leave, are you sure to bring that heavy chest? Can you really defend us with that extra weight on your back?",
"Sure, no problem Caroline.",
"You are right girl. I have to leave it for now, but I will plunder this shipyard again...",
"Oh no, they have locked the gate?!",			//100
"We have to get over the gate instead then. Quick, climb the ladder girl!",
"Captain, it's gunpowder in these barrels. Maybe we could have blown the gate to pieces? Just wait one moment and I'll fill up my supply.", 
"Please hurry, they may notice us any minute...",
"We must leave immediately before they hit us or the gunpowder barrels.",
"Jump girl, jump!",
"Are you badly hurt Captain?",
"No it's only a fleshwound, how about you Caroline?",
"I'm not hurt at all, just a little deaf. We made it, finally free again thanks to you my brave Captain.",
"It's nothing to talk about. Let's get out of here now.",
"My father will be so grateful to you Captain.",	//110
"Let's leave immediately then to Port Royale and Governor Woodes Rogers!",
"Sorry for running away from you like that my Captain. Thank you for taking all these risks saving me.",
"I'm only happy to see you're finally at home girl.",
"Now your reward is not far away.",
"This can be quite interesting...",
"First, if you please could make a visit to the booty room and clean yourself up a bit!",
"No problem, I'll return to see you later then.",
"Hello there again Captain! I see you're doing just fine with my fathers weird puzzles.",
"Hello Caroline it's good to see you.",
"As you had to trade away your uniform I have got something appropriate for a Captain.",//120
"Thank you Caroline, what is it?",
"I have an old padlock lying somewhere here, maybe you'll have use for that further on.",
"I'll take a good look around for it then.",
"Hello there Captain. Thought you might need some help!",
"Hello again Caroline, and thank you. Those monsters down there ...",
"I know - they say that the former sailors in my fathers duty end up in this godforgotten mine ...",
"Thanks again, and I also have a question Caroline - and this is a little difficult to express ...",
"Okay, let me guess - it's about the guards in my fathers duty, maybe the antique shop and my familys business on the whole?",
"Well it was Selkirk who told me ...",
"Alexander Selkirk is a very loyal man, but this is nothing he should run around and talk about!",//130
"I figure it's all true then??!!",
"Captain, you have found your way down here too!",
"How are you Caroline. There really are a lot of rooms in the Governors residence!",
"Oh yes Captain - and I would guess there still are some places left to explore. However, I found these in the bootyroom - maybe it could be something for you Captain?",
"What is it Caroline?",
"It's just a clean white skirt and a pair of used but very strong leather pants.",
"Well thank you!",
"Have you heard the awful news? Father Bernard, governor Silehard and other citizens have been kidnapped!",
"Yes I know Caroline, I'm here to collect what the bandits demand - medicines!!! I'm the one to run around all city seeking for those drugs - and then buy them - for what I ask. The pirate stole all my gold.",
"Maybe I can help you a little there Captain. Take this piece of jewelry - maybe you can get something for it.",//140
"That was very helpful of you Caroline. Hope it has not belonged to the Rogers family for ages.",
"How's that - being rude again?! No my father gave it to me as a birthday gift.",
"(A deed of piracy - no doubt about that) How old are you Caroline?",
"I'm 28 why?",
"Oh I'm just conversing that's all, farewell.",
"If you don't know how to find an etherbottle visit the Opium Den.",
"Oh thank you Caroline! (How did she know?)",
"Be careful Captain. I've heard the officers talk - they don't like you, the rewards you're receiveing or their Commander!",
"Yes they have appeared a little hostile...",
"It's more than that. They're after some secret in my father's possession. And I don't think anything can stop them!",//150
"Alright Caroline, I'll watch out for those gentlemen.",
"Please help me! They have shot my father!",
"Was it the officers?! Is the governor dead? What happened Caroline?",
"My father is dead or dying!! The officers are after something they believe my father has got. Quick, we must get away, they're after you as well Captain!",
"Yeah, I've noticed that...And I don't even have a sword.",
"Use one of your pistols as a club then!",
"Hmm (Why havn't I thought of that??!!",
"Lucky for us you found that belt Captain!",
"Lucky for me you were here to help me Caroline!",
"Enough of this - follow me to my father.",		//160
"Alright.",
"Yes Captain, they have murdered my father. We are all in danger - especially you!",
"Yes I have understood that. It's the pistolbelt they're after isn't it!?",
"Indeed it is. We can't fight them all - I think the only way is if you can persuade Charles Vane and associates to help us.",
"But they're notorious pirates!!",
"How many times do I have to tell you Selkirk: We're not pirates only traders -",
"- and besides that they can't possibly be worse than Dampier and his allies! ",
"They have locked us in here - all exits are blocked. But there still may be one way...",
"... and I have to swim!??",
"Maybe you have to Captain - the wine cellars are situated far below the ground and are often flooded.",//170
"Alright, show me the way out and I'll make an attempt with Charles Vane. (Not that easy I guess...)",
"Selkirk opens for you, just follow him. And Captain please be careful -",
"- all our hope is to you now.",
"Captain, you are here at last. Look what they did those bastards!",
"I'm really sorry Caroline, your father was a great man. Why did they kill him?",
"They are very greedy men Captain. First it was the pistols my father offered you and then they discovered there was also a map!",
"And, let me guess, they took the map? (Oh no!!)",
"In a way they did. My father was very cautious about showing the map though. He always worked with a copy.",
"So the original map is still here? (Just wondering...)",
"It is Captain. My father kept his most precious belongings in what he called Stephenson's Chest, try to find it. We are waiting for you downstairs in my drawing room.",//180
"Okey, I'll search this room. (YES, it's still here!)",
"I can see on your face that you did find the Chest Captain.",
"Yes Caroline, besides the map it was stuffed with valuable items. Thank you very much!",
"Grandma, who will take care of the Store -",
"- if you and Dave are both at sea?",
"Hornigold gave the map to my father to prove he had left the pirate business for good. My father belived him and commissioned him to hunt pirates.",
"Interesting story, any idea where Hornigold got the map from the beginning?",
"Governor Spotswood gave them to my father as a gift on his birthday.",
"Spotswood? Please Mr De Foe help us here....",
"Captain wait... we ehrmm, have a little present for you...",//190
"No, this is really too much.",
"Always good to see you again my dear Captain!",
"Hallo Caroline.",
"What do you say Grandma - ",
"- why don't we let Captain Pyle hire three sailors of his choice?",
"Quick - Behind you Captain!",
"Huh?",
"Go on Captain - what are you waiting for?",
"Ehrr.. I just.. hrmm.",
"Oh Captain, you're wounded!!",							//200
"Nothing to talk about. (But it hurts like hell)",
"I'm really not allowed to help you this much but you have to find a way to unlock my fathers bedroom.",
"Thanks Caroline.",
"Just a second. Look what I found on that greedy shopkeeper's body.",	//204
"That's a lot of money, Caroline.",					//205
"Yes Captain. And I think you should have them.",			//206
"This is really too much...",						//207
