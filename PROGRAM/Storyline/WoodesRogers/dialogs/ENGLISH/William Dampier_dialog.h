"What's in it for me?",
"Shrewd bargainer ehh?!",
"Do you want any help or not!",
"I knew I could rely on you Captain. Take this interesting book and see if you're able to repair it - the front cover is missing. Come back here with the restored book and I'll get you something ...Okay!?",

"Where did you say I could find the doctor?",
"I didn't but he's very fond of new clothes and stuff.",
"Hmm ...I see!",
"Another thing, you don't have the slightest idea of how to open that chest do you?",
"I havn't seen Mr Dover today. Why don't you bring that medicine chest, maybe I have something to show you - sailor-boy!",
"(I knew it!!!) Alright.",
"Very well, I have recruited some men for you and yes you may take this spyglass - if you know how to use it little sailor-boy.",
