"None of your business ",

"I didn't expect to see you here!",
"Glad to see you, too, ",
". I'm told you're spending your free time saving old people these days.",
"Now it's my turn to interrupt you. Where did you find such a useful lad, ",
"?",
"That's my secret, ",
". But you've heard what he had to say. So now we can work together, like I offered before.",
"Glad to see you waited for me. Now we can go together.",
"Of course. As soon as ",

" here tells us where we're going.",
"It's an ambush! Get yourselves to his house and lock yourselves in.\nI'll hold them off for as long as I can.",

"Ah. ",

"Finally awake, are you?",
"What happened?",
"The time has come to pay a visit to the governor and ask him some pointed questions.",
"I'm right with you. Let's go.",
"Good, but we can't barge into the residence in broad daylight. Let's wait in the tavern until night falls.",
"Smart thinking. And I could use a drink.",
"Look, the sooner we get some answers from the governor, the sooner we can trust each other again.",
"Yes. I suppose you're right.",
"First of all, let's get out of this town.",
"Agreed.",
"We should split up here. We can get into more trouble that way.\nYou track down that lad who copied the legend, and I'm going to go after the idol.",
"That works for me. We can meet up at the lighthouse, where the old man lives.",
"??? What are you doing here?!",
"I was looking for you! How could I be so stupid?!",
"Well, look what the tide washed in. I thought we agreed to meet at the lighthouse.",
"I got tired of waiting.",
"Well, I think you'll agree the wait was worth it. I've found a logbook. Let's see, now...hang on.... Blast it! There's nothing here about where to find him! Wait - quiet! I swear I heard a door creak. Someone's coming!",
"So? Now I can find that Spanish corsair who supposedly kidnapped the girl.",
"Go to the pirate's ship.",
"Not yet. It's not time for that.",
"Now I need to look for that girl. If she's not around here somewhere, I'm in deep trouble.",
"...",
"I barely got away from those fanatics! This business is turning out to be hotter than I thought.",
"I should report this to Padre Domingues. But who's this?",
"Lucas's kidnappers demanded the ransom to be brought to this tavern, but they don't seem to be here themselves.\nAha, those two at the bar seem to be waiting for someone...",

"It's already been a week. I need action!",
"We're talking about hundreds of pounds of gold. Isn't that worth a week of waiting?",
"To you, maybe. I can't take much more of this. I need to be on the move. Why can't he finish the translation on the ship?",
"You know, I never thought of that.",
"Yeah, I guess a pirate doesn't have much use for common sense, does he? So what use do you have for the gold, ",
"?",
"What?",
"Should I talk slower? What. Will. You. Do. With. Your share of the treasure?",
"I'll buy an English island, I suppose, and make my own rules. Or maybe I'll become an English peer. That could have its rewards. And you?",
"That's a secret.",
"All right. Be that way.",
"Are you going to stand against the regular fleet?",
"No. I'm going to shatter it!",
"I'll command the fort! Just watch out for the cannonade!",
"Just hit what you aim at!",
"We won! They'll be writing songs about that battle, or I'm an old sea hag! We could take the whole archipelago together! Or the entire Caribbean!",
"Sure we could. But it might make more sense to have a chat with ",

" first.",
"Listen to you, ",
"! You should be ashamed of yourself, crushing a sweet girl's dreams with your boring logic!",
"Treasure always comes first, my dear. Afterwards, if you still want to conquer the Caribbean, I'll be right with you. Consider it a promise.",

"I'm not sure the governor has any more warships.",
", the temple seems to be situated somewhere inland. Let's take a walk!",
"Right, but we don't want to call attention to ourselves. We should leave the crew here until we've checked out this temple with our own eyes.",
"I can't believe we made it! It's just a matter of time before we're rolling in ancient gold!",
"If there's any gold there at all.",
"Don't say that! We couldn't have come so far for nothing!",
"We'll see.",
"There are three passages here, and any one could be the right one. Where should we go?",
"I don't know. This could be the trap ",
"Researcher",
" was talking about.",
"Then we should split up. We'll cover more ground that way. I'll take the left passage for myself, and we'll see who finds the treasure first!",
"Hey, wait...",
"Looks like we can go to #sisland_Khael Roa# now!",
"I'm not sure it'll be so easy.",
"Maybe we should go ahead and search the temple while he's reading those squiggles.",
"Not without some idea of where we're going! The devil himself could get lost in that maze!",
"Have it your way, but I'm going for a walk. Oh! I already see something! Keep in mind I found it first!",
"What?",
"That's got to be the alcove ",
"Researcher",
" was talking about. But where's the treasure?",
"I don't know. Even if we pried all the gold from the walls, it wouldn't amount to much...",
"We can't waste much more time looking, ",
". They'll capture the town!",
"I just want to be sure you don't sink me, too, after we take care of the English fleet.",
"Now, that really hurts, ",
".",
"Kidding! I'm just kidding. Good luck!",
"Good Lord! What was that?",
"I don't know!",
"Three thousand devils, ",
"! No one could survive that! My treasure! Could we just try to get part of it? Just a wee bit?",
"I don't know. I suppose it's not the only treasure in the world.",
"What's the difference? Oh, this is such a bitter loss!",
"Somehow I get the feeling you're not as disappointed as you pretend to be.",
"I shouldn't go back there. I need to get out of #sRedmond# and fast!",
"That was a tough one, no? Are you still in one piece?",
"Well, I don't think I'm going to die today, anyway.",
"Glad to hear it - although I'm not sure Death generally cares what people like us think.",
"Let's go spring ",
"Researcher",
" from the jail.",
", one thing at a time. Let's save the poor old man first.",
"Whatever you say.",
"What should we do now? We can't find the treasure if we can't translate that legend. And I'm afraid the old man...",
"We've already set ourselves against the #sGovernor# and the English crown. What do we have to lose if we just capture that miserable town and free Aurentius?",
"I didn't realize you had suicidal tendencies. But if you're serious about this, then let's have a little fun!",
"Now you're talking! And I'm feeling like a real pirate. I'll attack the fort from the sea, and you and your men can lay siege to the town from land. What do you say?",
"I say I've created a monster, ",
". But I'm ready when you are!",
"Calm down! What happened?",
"What happened? I was told you were dead! I sailed to #sGreenford# to find out what really happened. The tavern owner told me he hadn't seen you. Then some lad approached me out of the blue and said he knew where you were. And I fell for it like a fool!",
"Relax. Everything's all right now. What happened then?",
"I sailed here to #sIsla Muelle# with that lying dog. He said that we'd meet with the pirates holding you prisoner. He led me into the jungle - and then ran off when I was jumped by two friends of his. By the time I'd dealt with them and returned to shore, he was gone. And so was my ship!",
"You went through all that for me? Cold and haughty Danielle rushed my rescue without a second thought!",
"Keep talking, and you'll be mumbling around my saber!",
"I'm through! Not another word, I promise! So...the tablets are completely lost to us?",
"You really do think I'm just a foolish girl, don't you? No, I kept them with me.",
", my dear, did I ever tell you you're the smartest lady pirate I know?",
"No. As I recall, you've mostly been enraptured by my 'unmatched sharp tongue.' Now tell me: How in the world did you get here?",
"After I captured the ship that was sent to deliver the idol to the #sGovernor#, I set a course for our meeting place. But I ran into foul weather and was washed overboard like a landlubber. I was sure I was dead, but as it happened I found myself washed ashore near #sisland_Douwesen#.",
"Yes. Fortune does favor the foolish.",
"Easy, now! I've had a rough time of it. When I came to my senses, I staggered into #sDouwesen# and managed to get a small ship. Not long after, I ended up here. You can well imagine how surprised I was to see my old ship in #sIsla Muelle# harbor. She was still being repaired after that storm.",
"Incredible! Fortune favors the foolish, but even you aren't fool enough to be THAT lucky!",
"Well, in that case...I made it all up. Yes! Just a tall tale to entertain you. At any rate, here I am.",
"And here I am. And now we have the idol. We should sail together to #sisland_Oxbay# and talk to Aurentius about translating that legend.",
"Oh, I didn't dare to dream you'd say that! Sailing together - it sounds so... sweet!",
", dear, do shut up!",
"Yes, I'm working for him.",
"You devil! And you've set an ambush for me at the town gate?!",
"I didn't...",
"Die!",
"Still playing hard to get, are you? Fair enough...",
"Just be quiet, ",
", will you?",
"It seems funny to you? I'd like to see you laughing with a pile of kindling at your feet!",
"So he was serious? I thought you helped him carry some food or something.",
"Seriously, though - what are you doing here?",
"I'm trying to find someone, but the closer I get, the harder things go for me.",
"I've been having more than my share of trouble, too.\nAnd all because of some lad. He's a captain, too, as it happens. Goes by the name of ",
"Raoul Rheims",
"Raoul Rheims",
".",
"Are you serious? We're looking for the same man! But why are you after him?",
"Gold, of course! A very powerful man wants a word with that devil, and he's promised me a tidy sum if I bring him in.",
"I see. Maybe we could look for him together.",
"I'm all for that, but I'll tell you up front that I have no clue where he is.",
"We're even, then - neither do I.",
"Well, we can't do any worse together than we've done apart. And it's got to be some kind of fate, our meeting like this.\nWhen shall we go searching for our mutual 'friend'?",
"Well, I have some business to settle here...",
"No problem. Actually, I've got some loose ends to tie up, myself.",
"Fine. Let's meet here in one week. What do you say?",
"Perfect. I'll see you then.",
"Good luck!",
"Don't you remember anything?",
"My head is splitting, ",
". Don't push me. Why don't you explain what you're doing here?",
"Hey, if anybody should be mad, it should be me! Catching that dagger where I did wasn't the most pleasant thing that ever happened to me!",
"You deserve it! I know you're hunting me for the English governor. Let's just settle this now. Draw your blade!",
"Settle down, ",
". You've got it all wrong. I'm not hunting you at all. I didn't even know that ",
"Robert Christopher Silehard",
" wanted you dead.",
"Don't give me that, ",
"! You've always said you'd do anything for money!",
"Oh, come on, ",
"! I was playing around! You expected me to be a scoundrel. You like scoundrels! I couldn't disappoint you.",
"What are you talking about?! I always considered you a honest man!",
"Oh, no! All that time we knew each other, and we were always at odds.",
"That's true enough! You were always trying to snatch the best jobs from under my nose!",
"But when did I ever do anything to you? From where I stand, it looks like I was always saving your skin!",
"Maybe. But you're still working for a man who wants me dead!",
"Yes, I was, ",
". I've recently...retired. But ",
"Robert Christopher Silehard",
" doesn't know that yet.",
"What, didn't he pay you enough?",
"Money's not the issue. Not this time. I just decided I didn't want to work for a man like him anymore.",
"What are you saying? You're a free man? Then leave me be!",
"Fine! I see you're as stubborn as ever. Good luck with the three corpses you've got on your hands.",
"?!",
"What else do you want?",
"...",
"Did you have something else to say, or can I go?",
"...Thank you...for your help, ",
". I'd be dead if not for you.",
"Forget it. Can I go?",
"Wait, ",
"! What are you going to do now?",
"I'm going to pose some questions to a certain dirty governor.",
"Just wait a minute, will you? You can't go there alone. That's suicide! If ",
"Robert Christopher Silehard",
" suspects anything at all, he'll kill you just to be safe!",
"Thanks, but I'll take my chances!",
"Not without me, you won't!",
"Why? I'll be fine alone.",
"First off, I have my own questions to ask him. And, second - ",
"What?",
"I know a good place to cast anchor on #sisland_Redmond#, where no one will be waiting for us.",
"All right, fine. We'll join forces for now.",
"Fine! But if you deceive me once more, ",
", I'll kill you, I swear!",
"What's going on? Those soldiers were trying to kill us!",
"I don't know, ",
", but you should head out of town - it's dangerous here.",
"So...where could he keep that paper? Let's see.",
"(Start searching)",
"The whole town is in a panic! They're shouting that the port is on fire. We can't go that way.",
"I have an idea. We'll say there are French troops in town. Shout it at the top of your lungs! It'll confuse the guards!",
"It looks like I see Nigel Blythe's figure far ahead. Interesting. Where could he be going?",
"...",
"Hm...Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems that one of my crew - Artois Voysey - just entered the town.",
"...",
"Officer Edgar Attwood just left my ship without my permission.",
"...",
"Hell! Somebody shot Artois! I must take him to a tavern and find a doctor for him!",
"...",
"Snorri: ...ing in this hole for two weeks already, and there's still no gold! And you told us that the old man will surely pay!",
"...",
"Billy: He will pay, he definitely will. But to gather so much gold is not such a quick thing to do.",
"...",
"Snorri: And what if he just doesn't give a devil's spit about his damn son?! What if instead of gold, a galleon full of bloodthirsty Spaniards comes here?!",
"...",
"Billy: Enough already! Have you ever seen a father who'd abandon his son in a situation like this? Don't worry, the admiral will pay the ransom. He doesn't really have a choice.",
"I've heard enough. These are the ones that I need. (Show them the sign)",
"Now to free Padre Domingues!",
"The cells are off to the right. Let's go.", 
"(I see a small mound of stones)",
"I bet there is something buried here. I'm going to dig.",
"(Ten minutes later)",
"What a beautiful sword! But there is a name engraved on the blade...",
"PETER! WHERE ARE YOU GOING???",
"Hmm... He doesn't seem to hear me anymore. I better follow him. He seems to be running to the store.",
"(A sudden storm is roaring)",
"Strange. Where did that storm suddenly come from? I better leave this place quickly.",
"(Another sudden storm is roaring)",
"Another sudden storm? I don't like this.",
"(The Spaniards detect your presence)",
"MOOOVEEEE!!!!! BROTHERS OF THE COAST!!!",
"(You see the port soldier)",
"That's him again! Let's catch him!",
"(Barbossa talking to his crew)", 
"Gentlemen, the time has come! Our torment is nearing an end! For ten years we've been tested and tried. And each man here has moved his mettle a hundred times over and a hundred times again. Punished we were the lot of us, disproportionate to our crime. Here it is! The cursed treasure of Cortés himself. Every last piece that went astray we have returned. Save for this!",
"Maybe you are immortal, but I can still knock you out idiot! Now, I have to join my crew to invert the situation on my ship.",
"Captain ",
"You are accused for crimes against the Crown. Said crimes being numerous in quantity and sinister in nature. The most egregious of these to be cited herewith: piracy, smuggling, sailing under false colours, arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching, brigandage, pilfening, depravity, depredation and general lawlessness. For these crimes, you are sentenced to be hung by the neck until dead. May God have mercy on your soul.",
"... I would seem not! ...",
"Oh well! ... I shall have to do the noble deed myself.",
"[The cursed coin in the necklace around Elizabeth's neck has called the #scursed_ship#]",
"Hmm... not one of my better days!",
"Now, there's a ship that might give me some leverage. I should go and take a closer look.",
"(I see the sand has been moved)",
"Someone has buried something here.",
"(Two minutes later)",
"A MAP! I bet the gold is there.",
"(Eight boxes of gold are in the cave)",
"I found the gold... but only a small part of the gold stolen in Aguadilla. Where is the rest?",
"(A few days later)",
"Time has come to see again my informer. Let's hope he found something.",
"(Two days later in the tavern)",
"Tonight, I must see the treasure.",
"(You listen to the conversation of these soldiers)",
"They belong to the Silver Fleet... I must warn Elting they installed a fortified camp in front of the fort.",
"(At night, you hear somebody walking)",
"Who is here?",
"(Your ship is weighing anchor)",
"Bastard! He will pay for that.",
"(A few hours later)",
"It's too hot! I quickly need to drink water otherwise I'll die over the next two days.",
"(You've finished to dig a hole in the sand)",
"Damn it! There is no water on the islet.",
"(The day after)",
"Yesss!! it's raining. Thank you God! Finally WATER!",
"(Many days have passed)",
"I should explore the islet to know if nobody was here before me and let something.",
"(You find a dagger)",
"Excellent! I could use it with a stick to kill the fishes around the islet.", 
"(You see a ship approaching)",
"Come heeere! Help meeeee!!!",
"(You see a beautiful young woman.)",
"[Thinks] I'm going to talk to her. She seems alone.",
"(You see a War Galleon in the port.)",
"[Thinks] What a beautiful ship! She has got a lot of cannons. I could use her for the diversion operation. I'll talk about this to my companions tonight. Now, I must join the Governor at his residence.",
"(You hear a quarrel in the residence's garden.)",
"[Thinks] What?! But it's the Governor's daughter discuting... I'm going to talk to her to understand what's happening.",
"(Talking to everyone)",
"Gentlemen, time has come to explain what's my plan. At the beginning of the night there will be 4 operations. I and my crew will seize a Spanish ship in the port. It's the 'San Martin': a warship of 56 cannons. Two reasons about that. First, I want to prevent the ship from shooting at the fort during our attack. The second is more personal, I lost the 'Santiago' with the mutiny and seeing I need a new one when the mission accomplished, as well have this one.",
"I think everyone knows what he has to do. So, good luck!",
"(Talking to your crew)",
"Fight the soldiers, but leave the captain to me!",
"Strange, I got the feeling that -",
"- ........",
"(You see the Dutch forces preparing the assault)",
"[Thinks] Good! Captain Dierman and Elting are ready to attack. Let's inform Captain Queiroz.",
"Let me see. Where to start looking. Every captain has a logbook. It could be in the box over there...",
"Phew! I feel like I've been asleep for a week, and the stubble I had on my chin confirmed it. Now I've had a wash and tidy up, I must look for Hunter.",
"A good night's rest at last. Now to find Mr. Bush.",
"Nothing worth having at the moment. I should spend some time in the tavern and try again later. Also, I'll need to see if the store can sell me a map of #sisland_Cuba#'s waters.",
"Looks like the crew fell for it. Now to grab the ship before they realise they've been had.",
"The ship's papers ought to be somewhere around here - aha, got them! Ship 'Tonina' - what sort of name is that, we'll need to change it! Captain is - or rather, was - Alférez de Navío Esteban Rovapera.",
"So much for buying a map of #sisland_Cuba#. But there's one right in the window. I'll have to return when it's dark.",
"So much for buying a map of #sisland_Cuba#. But there's one right in the window. And it's dark now...",
"Wait a moment... that rope had better be tied securely!",
"Trying to spy on our intimate moment, are you? Get lost or you'll be intimately acquainted with my sword!",
"I've collected all six books and documents.",
"Now I only have to return them to the clerk.",
"Okay, I have to be really quick about it -",
"- using that shutter to continue.",
"Hmm, I'm not sure that this beam can take my weight -",
"- I'll have to be very careful here.",
"If I could reach that bell up there -",
"- maybe he thinks it's a fire alarm!?",
"Two quick cannon shots -",
"- if I remember it right that would mean a swedish ship.",
"Yes! There it is finally -",
"- but where is the entrance?",
"- and the entrance is through the mountain.",
"Aha, there is the Oriel room - now how should I get there?",
"Over the roofs for sure - but where to start?",
"What was that -",
"- cavalry!?",
"I'll try this liquid on the single silver bar",
"upstairs in the laboratory first.",
"I can't belive it! It really turned into gold!",
"Now let's try it on the huge pile of silver bars downstairs...",
"I'm rich, I'm rich!!!",
"I can turn any worthless metal into gold!",
"I have to stop him -",	
"- before he'll blow us to kingdom come.",		//354
"Oh no! She has locked me out!",
"How do I open this Gate - with explosives?!",
"Hmm.........",
".......that's not a bad idea.",
"I really have to",
"get away fast when the fuse is lit!",
"The gunpowder has dried into a huge lump -",
"- if there's something hidden inside I have to brake it up.",
"I'll need a workbench -",
"- but also tools and maybe some liquid to process this pile.",
"Now it's just to wait for Mr Richards to return from town -",
"- with the items we demanded from the citizens of Charleston!",
"Now I want that pistol of yours...",
"Sure why not.",
"Yes that's it -",
"- now back to the Abbess.",
"This is a real maze! How should we find Eden's Office -",
"- can you tell me that Mister Hands?",			//372
"Very well. But we will also need your map to succeed -",
"- what happened to it, Caesar? And speak the truth now.",
"Are you Israel Hands?",
"Who's asking?",
"My name is Captain Howard Pyle.",
"Never heard of you, Captain. No I'm not this 'Hands'.",	//378
"Hmm, the Captain who was marooned by his own crew.",
"Aaaargh, you shot me in the knee!!!!",
"What's the meaning of this??",
"What did Blackbeard mean by 'save your life' -",
"- he almost killed you?",
"Let's say we could kill them. How do we get out?",		//384
"There must be an exit from this part of the prison.",
"How can you so sure about that?",				//386	
"Took didn't take Bonnet's group the very long way up through all the prison levels you arrived.",
"No? Any ideas how?",						//388
"I can hear running water - where does it leave this goddamned place?",
"Okay, I'll take a closer look!",				//390
"Be quick about it and then get the keys before Took wakes up again.",
"I could use some tools here.",				//392
"I've already checked that. There are some bars blocking the way.",	//393
"Okay - tools required then. Now get the keys before Took wakes up again.",
"No! I have to find weapons for these guys first.",	//395
"Now be very quite and I'll provide you with some weapons.",
"Yes! We'll kill them all.",
"Two guards are needed: one at Took's door and the other one at the exit. Double quick but silent.",
"Aye aye Captain.",					//399
"This is how we'll do it: Follow me to the next room. Be very quite and find yourself hiding places for the ambush!",
"And then?",
"The soldiers are in the lowest room. I'll try to get them to follow me up the stairs.",
"And then we hit 'em!!",
"The prisoners are killing each other! Two of them look dead!",
"Come on guys - this could be interesting.",
"Hide those corpses before Took wakes up. I'll go search for some Tools.",	//406
"Where should we put them?",
"Drag them off to one of the cells. Very fast now and not a sound!",
"Take Tookerman to a cell - I'll lock him up.",					
"All is lost, the treasure is lost! Where am I, and where are all the others?",							//410
"Maybe I can get some help from that camp. That tower and its flag...",
"Hmm it's not a british flag...",
"...more like a pirate flag -",
"- MY PIRATE FLAG!!",
"I can't believe it, I've completely run out of luck. It can be the Mutineers!",
"So this is it. I'm dead.   Ehh...",				//416
"... wait a minute. How can I be dead if I can think???",
"I can also hear the sea now -",				//418
"- but why is it so dark?",

"- still after all these years at sea, those heights makes me sick.",
"Hope they'll send someone ashore -",
"- another hand is needed to lift the Boat.",
"Ok, I guess the Compasses are F3 + F3 -",		//430
"- and the Map F3 + fire pistol.",

"- and almost me too.",

"- except the two hidden items!",

"- how can I thank you, wherever you are...",

"- WE ARE ALL RICH AS TROLLS!!!",
"Alright. Now...",	//442
"...who can swim?",
"Very well. (Have to get rid of that girl one day) ",		//444
"Sailors, take the soldiers uniforms and muskets and gather at the boats.",
"Swimmers, run to the shore -",		//446
"- and wait for me there.",
"Now Gentlemen -",			//448
"- please change outfits too.",
"I want you three to take command of the boats.",
"Aye aye, Captain.",
"I'll go first to check the next deck -",		//452
"- wait for my signal.",
"It's empty! So far so good -",		//454
"- and I've already found the way down to the slaves!",

"It's very empty here - the crew's probably sleeping behind those two doors over there. So King David, follow me to that deck.",
"Stay here King and guard those stairs while I examine the Hold.",		//458
"Aye aye, Captain.",
"I should hurry up and block that door -",		//460
"- before someone enters.",
"Schh, I have found the weapons lockers and the Key to the prisoners, I think.",	//462
"King, pick up weapons for the officers and six prisoners and follow me.",
"SHUT UP YOU FOOLS!! Are you going to kill us all!?",		//464
"If you just sit down and keep calm we've got weapons for you...",
"Hey you, wake up guys - you're free soon.",		//466
"It's too late for them, Captain.",
"Keep up the good work, Crimson! I'll look for the Gunpowder Storage.",		//468
"Sure, Captain.",
"Alright listen up all. We have to do this very quick and in complete silence. Understood!?",	//470
"What will happen to us when we've helped you take the ship? Back in chains?",
"No! You'll have a choice: join us or leave the ship at a safe place.",		//472
"How can we trust you? You're pirates after all.",
"We are waiting for our main force to arrive from the shore -",			//474
"- but remember they'll be dressed in red coats, like english soldiers.",
"There are also six convicts,  who will stay down here - ",			//476
"- guarding the new prisoners - the slavers!",
"??? Let's go on now. Next I need two resolute fellows to guard the exits on the deck above this. -",	//478
"- The crew is sleeping there and we don't want any surprises!",
"Yes keep quiet! I want you Monk, to be in charge of the reserve force -",	//480
"- be ready at the stairs in the next hold, if anything goes wrong upstairs.",
"Listen guys -",								//482
"- this is what I want you to do...",
"Okay, what I tried to say earlier -",						//484
"- when I was interrupted is this:",
"For the last time -",								//486
"- I want you six to...",
"Is it finally quiet now so I can continue?",					//488
"Go on Captain.",
"Okay, this is how we'll do it -",						//490
"- first you'll get ammo and then...",
"You again! Talk to the convicts while we start sending the slavers down.",	//492
"Very well, Captain.",
"Oh no! It has gone wrong before it even started -",				//494
"- all hands on deck!!",
"We'll wait here until dark...",						//496
"Aye aye, Captain.",
"Gentlemen, the Corvette is ours -",						//498
"- finally a three-master!!!",
"Drop your weapons and sit down -",						//500
"- if you want to live!",
"Two crewmembers will be promoted to officers.",				//502
"Who are they, Captain?",
"Crimson Pirate will be First Mate",						//504
"and King David Gunner.",
"It's time to set a course, Mr Hands.",						//506
"Where to, Captain?",
"Home Mr Hands - Home!",							//508
"That's Jamaica, aye aye. I suggest British colors, Captain.",
"Alright gentlemen -",								//510
"- you've got ten minutes to prepare our departure!",
"Get rid of the bodies and raise the Swedish flag.",				//512
"Alright! Quartermaster, let him sign the articles.",				//513
"Aye aye Captain, what's your name doctor?",
"Oh yeah, one more thing. No british outfits and muskets to the weaponslocker.",//515
"And where did he find such a valuable item - in the sand maybe?",		//516
"No Captain, in the warehouse... it was empty and I thought...",	
"Quickly now, stuff away that thing - or we'll be at war with the spanish.",	//518
"Hey Gunnar - come over here.",							//519
"Yah yah, I'm coming.",
"Gentlemen, to be honest with you -",						//521
"- I took the ship and liberated the poor bastards.",
"Very well, we have agreed to accept a swedish Letter of Marque -",		//523
"- let's hope this partnership will be very profitable.",
"There's one freedman in a swedish uniform, see to that he's joining the shore party. ",	//525
"I can't believe it -",								//526
"- they didn't think of me as the 'Kristiania thief'.",
"Now let's get out of here -",
"- before that Governor talks to his wife!",
"No problem -",					//530
"- now I can finally search your office more thoroughly.",
"How did you know I was in this town?",		//532
"I didn't but Claire told me.",
"Okay, is she here too?",			//534
"No. She...ehh...never mind.",
"That was worst idea for a novel I ever heard -",				//536
"- 'Lilliputians' and gigants!!!",
"That explains it. You are 'Captain' Charles Johnson, the author of the book I saw!",		//538
"Yes that's true.",
"I've got the First Aid Plaster Tape so maybe it's possible...",		//540
"...to repair Richard's map!",
"I have to search for glue or something else...",				//542
"Now let's search the archipelago map for this island...",		//543
"I think it's",		//544
"Antigua.",		//545
"Aruba.",		//546
"Barbados.",		//547
"Bonaire.",		//548
"Cayman.",		//549
"Cozumel.",		//550
"Cuba.",		//551
"Curacao.",		//552
"Eleuthera.",		//553
"Guadeloupe.",		//554
"Hispaniola.",		//555
"Isla Mona.",		//556
"Jamaica.",		//557
"La Grenade.",		//558
"La Tortue.",		//559
"Martinique.",		//560
"Nevis.",		//561
"New Granada.",		//562
"Petit Tabac.",		//563
"Puerto Rico.",		//564
"Saint Martin.",	//565
"Turks.",		//566
"Hmm, I'm still not sure if it's right. Better check again.",	//567
"Yes, it's Turks!",	//568
"I have to clean up the map, but very carefully. If I damage the map I'm finished as a Pirate Captain. What should I use?",	//569
"Cognac.",			//570
"Water.",			//571
"Antidote.",			//572
"Which temperature should the liquid have?",	//573
"Cold.",			//574
"Tepid.",			//575
"Warm.",			//576
"How much should I use?",	//577
"Just a few drops.",		//578
"Enough.",			//579
"Plenty.",			//580
"How should I apply the liquid?",		//581
"Just pour it over the map.",			//582
"With a piece of cloth ripped from my skirt.",	//583
"With more gunpowder.",			//584
"With sand.",			//585
"No liquid.",		//586
"With a bandage.",		//587
"I think it worked! Now let's see what we've got.",	//588
"I've ruined the map! The crew is not going to like this!",		//589
"Without any liquid how should I clean up the map?",	//590
"I'll try to blow away the gunpowder dust.",		//591
"No, I have to try something else. What?",		//592
"I still havn't found what I'm looking for...",		//593
"I've got it. Let's take a closer look!",		//594
"Yes, it's Curacao! ",	//595
"But tell me Mister De Foe, you knew this already?",		//596
"Of course I did. But I thought you enjoyed these puzzles.",	//597
"Okay, if the letters should make words - the only thing I come to think of is 'Saint something'. Many islands have names like that.",	//598
"Indeed but the rest of the letters don't work. Try again - read it top to bottom, left to right.",			//599
"K...RI...ST...I...ehh...AN...IA. Kristiania. Now that could be an island name, but none I've ever heard of.",	//600
"But I have. It's not an island but a town.",		
"Do you know where in the Caribbean, mister De Foe?",		//602
"Unfortunately it's not in the Caribbean at all but in Europe.",
"Europe?! And where there if I may ask? Could it be a clue?",	//604
"It's a name of a town in Norway. And also a part of the danish capital Copenhagen.",
"Norway, Denmark what's next - Sweden? This is becoming worse and worse.",	//606
"Not entirely. Sweden you say, I have also heard about a swedish not so prospering town called Kristiania.",
"And where would that be? In Africa perhaps, this time?",		//608
"Africa's good. They had a colony there for a while. But no, this should be in the Caribbean. But I have nu idea of where.",
"It's not much - but after all it's something to follow up.",		//610
"Yes! Let's continue now, please give me the map again and I'll mark the red ports as well.",
"Hmm, let's think. Two points can generate a line. Six points - three lines. Maybe those three lines will cross each other in the same spot?",	//612
"But why three lines? Two lines (four points) would have been enough. I like the idea of lines though. So - the map please.",	//613
"Lines yes - but I can't make anything valuable out of them.",		//614
"Grr, let me try again",						//615
"Sorry Mister De Foe, it's hopeless.",					//616
"Never! The map!",							//617
"YES. That's it. Now I see why 6 points were needed. Three lines - one triangle.",
"Indeed. That was the trick. It's Isla Mona!",	//619
"It looks like Daniel De Foe up there. Wait for me here men.",	//620
"To the farm then.",			//621
"But Captain, we have no ship.",
"We'll get the Marquis sailed to the farm when they have repaired the sloop.",
"Alright, the long way then - through the shipyard.",
"Hmm, this doesn't feel right - not right at all. I have to try something else.",	//625
"What should I use this time?",			//626
"To the weatherdeck now -",			//627
"- before it's too late!",			//628
"It's time to set a course -",			//629
"- to Jamaica and HOME!",			//630
"That was a lot of information. In fact so much, I've not decided where to sail first.",	//631
"I have to search the wreck and the shore better.",		//632
"There's still some gunpowder there and it has dried into a huge lump, that's it -",		//633
"- I'll return when I know more about this.",			//634
"I lost a treasure but found another one. Besides that I took a Corvette. And yes, there's one thing I saved from the treasure.",	//635
"The damaged book Minerva told us about?",			//636
"No, it's a painting I thought could be valuable.",		//637
"A painting. Sigh. Take a look Dave, if it's anything...",	//638
