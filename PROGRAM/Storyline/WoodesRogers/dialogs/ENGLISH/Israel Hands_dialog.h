"Caesar!!",
"But... but.. I thought you were hanged in Williamsburg?",
"What do you want, Captain?",
"Oh nothing.",
"Oh yes. You can get to it from the wine cellars.",
"How do you know this?",
"I followed Teach to Governor Eden many times.",		//6
"He wanted to visit the Governor incognito of course. Can you show me the way Mister Hands?",
"Indeed I can. We always started from Teach's own house.",	//8
"Aha, that must be the big mansion on top of the hill.",
"Follow me, Captain.",
"Let's go then! Mister Pell, please guard the Office door if someone's in there.",
"Let's go then!",
"The Office is to the left, and up the stairs -",
"- but it was something tricky with the elevator to open that door.",
"No Captain, this will never work. The water's going to block the door to the Wine Cellars.",
"Let's wait in the house for the low tide then.",
"I'm listening...",		//17
"We used the Creek to find our way in the dark between the coast and the cellar entrance.",
"Give a coin to a poor man ",	//19
"and it will come back to you tenfold!",
"But yes, I am Israel Hands. What do you know about me?",	//21
"You sailed with Blackbeard as his Navigator to start with. Also that you were pardoned in the very last moment.",
"That's true and I've got papers to proove the courts verdict.",//23
"I'm sure you have. No, I want to ask you about something else...",
"How about a coin for your questions?",				//25
"First I have found out that you received a map piece from Blackbeard. Second I offer you a share if you contribute with it.",
"But I don't have it any longer.",				//27
"No..?",
"One night in the cabin of Queen Anne's Revenge I was drinking with Captain Teach, 'Major' Stede Bonnet, the very drunken pilot and a merchant Captain.",//29
"Yes..?",
"Well as you see, I'm alive while all the others are dead and gone.",		//31
"But you lost your leg. Despite of all the Surgeons?",
"Yes I got gangrene so they had to take the leg off. But I lost more than that.",	//33
"Your map piece. And it was Stede Bonnet who stole it. Now that's something to follow through.",
"It's not. He was hanged too.",							//35
"Do you know when and where?",
"Nothing in this world is free. But for that share you offered I'll give you the Town.",			//37
"Of course. That's a promise.",
"Alright then. Bonnet was hanged 1718 in Charleston by Sir William Stapelton, the governor.",	//39
"Aha, that's something. Come on what are you waiting for.",
