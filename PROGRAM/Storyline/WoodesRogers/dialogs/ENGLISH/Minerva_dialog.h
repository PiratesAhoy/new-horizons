"Alright I'll have a closer look then.",

"Did you fill up the cauldron with water Captain?",
"Hmm, guess I missed that Minerva.",

"Thanks, I got it.",					//69

"Save very often, Captain! My advice is to do it after each single success, at any work station.",	//95
"Do you know how to find 'Smugglers Lair' on La Grenade island?",			//96
