"You have come to set us free, captain?",
"Hmm, sure why not - but who are you and why are you locked up in here?",
"We're the cannon crew, a little deaf perhaps but very loyal to governor Rogers and his family.",
"And the officers are not reliable men, is that what you mean?",
"No, not at all - they're planning to remove Woodes Rogers as their leader!",
"What's the reason for that? Are they not happy with their share of the booty?",
"No, they believe Rogers has a secret hidden somewhere...",
"And what is that supposed to be - an item - or is it just rumours?",
"It has something to do with those pistols the Governor has offered you.",
"These pistols - I thought they were just some nostalgia for the old folks?",
"Be warned Captain - they sure want to take over those guns as well as that other thing.",
"Alright, thank you - I'll be careful!",
"One more thing - try to unlock the ammunition deck for us.",
"I'll see what I can do about that - where is it located?",
"It's right above us, and Captain - if you need our service just toll the bell on quarterdeck!",
"I'll remember that, maybe we'll meet again!",
"Your orders Captain?",
"Wad!",
"Ram!",
"Sponge!",
"Powder!",
"Shot!",
"Turn!",
"Dismiss!",
"Aye aye",
"Captain.",
"But Captain it's impossible, the cannon is too high up!",
"Alright (Hmm, should have thought of that.)",
"But Captain it's impossible, the cannon is too heavy to turn around!",
"But Captain, the ammunition deck is still locked!",
"Fire!",
"But Captain, that's your job!",
"Move!",
"But Captain, there are no cannon balls left!",
"Is that so?!",
"Thanks for saving us from drowning Captain. Now we're going to remove this thing for you.",
"Go ahead!",
"Never mind.",
"But Captain you have not found your Powderhorn yet!",
"I havn't decided yet! (I'm not sure what to do next...)",
"Maybe you need a handbook in Cannon Drill, Captain?",
"Maybe I do - where can I get one?",
"Try the Military Headquarter - it is located near the Docks.",
