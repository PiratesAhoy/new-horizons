"Who are you? And what are you doing in my house? ",
"Ahh, sorry for the intrusion, Madame. My name is Howard Pyle and I am interested in buying the estate.",
"Pleased to meet you, Mr Pyle. I am Mrs Margaret Pough - the owner.",
"Did you know governor Eden well, Mrs Pough?",
"Indeed, I am his niece.",
"Mrs Pough, I couldn't inspect any of the rooms - all doors were locked?",
"We have a problem here finding the keys to all rooms. Let's return to the main building now and I'll see what I can do.",
"Thank you Mrs Pough.",
"Ahh, there you are Mr Pyle. What took you so long?",
"(That bloody maze!) Oh nothing - I just enjoined the garden. (and it's creatures)",
"Very well. I have opened one of the bedrooms for you. Maybe you can reach the other rooms from there, Mr Pyle.",
"I hope so. See you later Mrs Pough.",
"Yes Mr Pyle, what can I do for you?",
"Oh sorry to disturb you Mrs Pough.",
"Mr Pyle, I think you have visited all of the Estate rooms now. Even the Chapel! So, what do you say?",	//14
"Hmm, not quite all rooms yet. There is still the Office (to explore). How do I get in there?",
"I'm sorry - I don't really have any idea. My uncle had his own key of course, but it has disappeared now.",
"Any other way into his Office, maybe?",
"Not at all. That's the residence of Tobias Knight, my uncle's Secretary.",
"Okay, Mister Hands lead the way out.",
"One more thing Captain... If you hope to find something to steal in the rooms - I can assure you everything of value has been removed.",
"What...How... I'm no thief Mrs Pough (well...)",
"How dare you? This is Tobias Knight, the Governors secretary -",
"- you will punished for this, slave!",
"Hand over that paper at once -",
"- or I'll sell you as soon as possible!",
"Stop them -",
"- stop the Pirates!",
"Get out! Get out of here -",
"- and don't ever come back.",
"Not that I am aware of.",		//30
"Hmm, maybe I have to come back later for a more thorough exploration.",
