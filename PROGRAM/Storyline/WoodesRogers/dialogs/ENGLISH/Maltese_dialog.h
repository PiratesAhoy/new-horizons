"What can I help you with? Medical care, spriritual consultation or military help?",
"Oh, none. I'm looking for the governor. Is he around?",
"Maybe he is. What if you do me a favour before I show you the way?",
"Very well, let's hear it.",
"I'm responsible for all the paperwork here. Documents and books have been moved around a lot.",
"And you want me to find them. How many items are we talking about?",
"There are totally six books and documents missing.",
"No problem.",
"Not so fast, here take these keys. Remember there are nine cells to be opened.",
"I'll be back very soon. (can't be that hard)",
"Have you found all books and documents yet?",				//10
"Indeed I have. Here they are.",
"Not all I'm afraid. I'll keep searching...",
"Very good. Now with this key you'll soon find the governor.",
"Goodbye.",
"Was it something else?",
"No, I'll be on my way now.",
"And who might you be?",
"Howard Pyle, at your service.",
"It's not common with a simple pirate wanting to join the Order.",
"Oh I'm just a poor sailor Governor, looking for some information.",	//20
"Hah! This society has its secrets not to be revealed to anyone.",
"I understand that, Sir. What I'm interested in is the fate of a certain Major Stede Bonnet.",
"That's easy to tell. That pirate was hanged in this town and by my order.",
"Yes, so I have heard. My question is where was he kept in prison before the execution?",
"He and two others were first locked up here in this cellar.",
"Yes...",
"Later they were moved to a safer place - a real prison.",
"Aha, and where would that be?",
"The prison no one ever has escaped from - the prison outside the Fort in Antigua.",
"Thank you Governor for your time. Goodbye.",			//30
"Just one more thing. The Order has among many other things a very valuable relic. Please don't try to steal it.",
"Of course not. (very valuable hmm)",
"Are you wounded or ill?",
"No, I'm just looking around.",
"The path of piracy leads only to damnation, my son.",
"Uhh.. yes.",
"Did I hear 'out of date'?",
"No, of course not Sir.",
"Do you have any complaints about any of my men?",
"Certainly not Captain.",
"Hmm,... (so he can still be there) Do I have to pass through the Fort?",			//41
"Certainly. Look we have a meeting here and you are interrupting us...",
"Oh I'm really sorry for that. Just one more thing, Governor. If you would be so kind and helped me with a document of some kind...",
"Alright maybe that's the quickest way. What was your name again?",
"Very well. This paper will let you pass through the Fort and also visit the Prison.",
"And all three were hanged later?",		//46
"Only Stede Bonnet. One officer was killed and the third one pardoned.",
