"Hey, you there! You look suspicious to me. Who the hell are you? Show me your papers!",
"Who the hell are YOU? Identify yourself, and be quick about it!",
"Halt! I have never seen you before, but you have the face of a pirate! Can you prove that you are none?",
"I am ",
", and here is my Pass. Was that quick enough for your rather short temper?",
"Oh, yes, of course, Sir! Here, my identification is in this purse, right below the 500 Gold. *WINK*",
"If you don't get lost at once I will show you how quick I am... with my blade!",
"Don't you dare to adress a superior in that manner again, you insolent hireling! Don't you know me? I am the Royal Inspector of His Majesty's Caribbean Regiments, and I have just arrived with the last ship to survey our troops here! Now don't molest me any longer, or you'll have to explain to your commander why I have missed my appointment with him!",
"Ah, yes, the picture on the coins identifies you as a man who has a heart for underpaid guards, hehe. Allright, I'll let you pass, but only this time. And behave!",
"Of course! Who do you think I am? A rogue? *WINK*",
"I don't trust you! ALARM! RAISE THE MILITIA!",
"Nice try, fella, but not with me! ALARM! A spy! Raise the Hue and Cry!",
"What's this? ALARM! A pirate!",
" Looks like my SKILLS were insufficient for THAT approach. Or was it just bad luck? Well",
" I hope my fencing will be more successful than my playacting...",
"Umm... err... I see. Sorry for having bothered you, Sir. Goodbye.",
"Allright, carry on, and a quiet watch to you.",
"Haven't you read the 'NO TRESPASSING' signs at the gate? This is a top secret Army fortification, and only soldiers of the elite Coastal Brigade may enter. Anyone else will be considered a spy! Especially certain privateering shipcaptains!",
"Sign? Sorry, I can't read. And I have an urgent appointment with the royal inspector... eh, I mean I am the inspector and have...",
"Any orders, Sir?",
"Nothing for now."
