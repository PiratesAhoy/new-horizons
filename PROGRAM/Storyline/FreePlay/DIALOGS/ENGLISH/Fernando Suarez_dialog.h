"Who are you, Senor?",
"Don't speak so loudly. There must be many guards in the house...",
"Did you come to free me?",
"I suppose you're the Elvira Suarez's husband?",
"Yes, but I still don't know who you are.",
"I work for your wife. And yes, I came to free you.",
"Thanks God. I had almost lost the faith to be released.",
"I'd like to explain better the situation but I have no time to talk, Fernando. The kidnappers could enter in the room at any time. Follow me, we must run away.",
"I think I can now tell you why I wanted to be here.",
"I hope so. We are taking unnecessary risks delaying your return.",
"I was not in #sSantiago# for business reasons when I was kidnapped.",
"What do you mean?",
"It's a long story. Let me explain in the tavern.",
"Alright. Let's go.",
"Do you know Bartolomeu o Portugues?",
"Of course, it was a famous Portuguese pirate. He has participated to the battle of Aguadilla and attacked the fortresses of #sHavana# and #sCartagena#.",
"Right. But, it's also my great grandfather.",
"What? I must say it's a bit ironic. You're Spanish and he was not known to be friend of the Spaniards.",
"Yes, but he has loved a Spanish woman.",
"Who?",
"Lady Lucia Montavez. He met her when he was in mission in #sCartagena#. She was the #sCartagena# Governor's daughter.",
"That's unbelievable... How did the Governor agree to let his daughter marry with a pirate, an enemy of Spain?",
"He didn't. Almost one year after the events of #sCartagena#, Lucia Montavez ran away from this Spanish town and asked protection to the governor of #sisland_Conceicao#. She knew Bartolomeu used to work for this Portuguese Governor. When Bartolomeu, returning from a mission, met her in #sisland_Conceicao#, it just took one month for them to be married. Of course, his father disinherited her...",
"So, they lived in #sisland_Conceicao#?",
"Yes, during almost 15 years. Thanks to the gold earned in his expeditions, he bought a lot of lands and became the biggest landowner of #sisland_Conceicao#.",
"A successful landowner after being a successful pirate...",
"Unfortunately, the luck took a turn for the worst.",
"How?",
"In my family, I'm not the only one that has been kidnapped by pirates.",
"Bartolomeu was kidnapped?",
"No, he's had a boy and a girl with Lucia. But, when he was only 13 years old, the boy was kidnapped. In that time, Bartolomeu was an old man. He refused to pay the ransom and decided to find the pirates, kill them and free his son.",
"A too dangerous mission for an old man. He didn't succeed, right?",
"Indeed. He has never come back home, neither his son.",
"What happened to his wife?",
"Despite her sadness, she stayed in #sisland_Conceicao# ruling the family's business but not for too long. Six months later, a fire burned her mansion and all the stocks of sugar. The Governor of #sisland_Conceicao# refused to help her lending money so that she could continue her business.",
"Bartolomeu dead, the Governor didn't care for the rest of the family.",
"Exactly. So, she has had to leave #sisland_Conceicao# and go to #sHavana# to live with her cousin. The only person of her family who didn't repudiate her after her marriage.",
"I understand. But, why do you tell me all this?",
"Well, six months ago, I decided to go to #sisland_Conceicao# and visit the mansion where Bartolomeu and Lucia have lived. Of course, except a few walls, all the mansion had disappeared. But, miraculously, below the rubble, I found a chest. Inside it, there were some clothes and also a book. The Bartolomeu's diary to be more specific.",
"And?",
"The last entries of this diary is about the kidnapping of his son. I thought I could find some information about the whereabouts of his son.",
"Finding where his son was imprisoned could give you the location of the Bartolomeu's corpse if we admit he was killed by the pirates.",
"Indeed, I also think he died when trying to free his son. Unfortunately, I was unable to find this information in the book. At least, nothing of obvious. That's why, I lend the diary to someone here in #sSantiago#. He knows a lot about the history of the piracy in the Caribbean. I've had to let the book one or two days, time enough for him to find a clue. As you must guess, I was kidnapped before being able to pay a new visit to him.",
"Alright, do not waste more time. Let's go and see him.",
"Do you think his corpse is there?",
"Maybe. Anyway, we have no clue about another location and the island is not too far from here. We can try.",
"Where do we start our search?",
"The island is small. So, if the Bartolomeu's corpse is here, It won't be too hard to find him. Let's look for him into the jungle.",
"Captain, I found him! I've just taken his sword. His name is engraved on the blade.",
"Impressive! What do you want to do now?",
"I think it would be correct to take his corpse and bury him near the tomb of his wife in the Havana's cemetery.",
"You're right. He deserves better than rotting in a cave.",
"Your crew has loaded the corpse in the ship. Can we come back to #sHavana#?",
"Of course. Time to go!",
"During the journey, I thought about it. You deserve to keep his sword.",
"What? But, it belongs first to your family.",
"Yes, but with no help, I could be dead now in #sTortuga# without the opportunity of burying Bartolomeu near his wife.",
"Well, thank you for this awesome gift! I'll never forget your kindness. It was an honour to be with you in this adventure. See you, Fernando!",
