"Who are you? What are you doing here? And answer me or I will smash your heads!",
"Monsignore, forgive me, for I am going to sin.",
"And what will your sin be then?",
"I am going to force a priest to help us escape and get us a ship. #sallez#, go get us some robes!",
"So you are those fugitive pirates? I would be honoured to help you.",
"First of all, I am not a pirate. I just killed a man in a duel and then got sprung out of jail and after that I killed some Spanish soldiers. Second, why would you help us?",
"Okay, but you are a fugitive. I want to help you, because I, God forgive me, hate the governor and everyone who is under his direct command. Corrupt man. Now you wait here, I will get you those robes.",
"We'll wait, oh, and those doors are locked, aren't they?",
"Here they are. Now, in the harbour lies a galleon loaded with goods. It should not be heavily guarded anymore because most of the soldiers are looking for you. The ship is commisioned to ship some priests to a mission on #sisland_Hispaniola#. So with these disguise, you are certain to get access to the vessel.",
"Thank you, #sfather#. We have to go now, thank you for everything.",
"Wait! Take me with you! I want to get away from this damned city. Plus, if I go with you, the guards will certainly believe that you are the priests. So what do you say?",
"Alright, you can join us. Guide us #sfather#.",
"No, sorry we can't use an obese priest, but thanks for the disguises.",
"priest",
"Hurry",
