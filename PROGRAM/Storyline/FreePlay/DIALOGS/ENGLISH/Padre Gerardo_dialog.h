"Who are you? What are you doing here? And answer me or I will smash your heads!",
"Monseigneur, forgive me, for I am going to sin.",
"And what will your sin be then?",
"I am going to force a priest to help us escape and get us a ship. Allez, go get us some robes!",
"So you are those fugitive pirates? I would be honoured to help you.",
"First of all, I am not a pirate. I just killed a man in a duel and then got sprung out of jail and after that I killed some Spanish soldiers. Second, why would you help us?",
"Oke, but you are a fugitive. I want to help you, because I, God forgive me, hate the governor and everyone who is under his direct command. Corrupt man. Now you wait here, I will get you those robes.",
"We'll wait, oh, and those doors are locked, aren't they?",
"Here they are. Now, in the harbour lies a galeon loaded with goods. It isn't that heavily guarded anymore because most of the soldiers are looking for you. The ship is commisioned to ship some priests to a mission on #sisland_Hispaniola#. So with these disguise, you are certain to get acces to the vessel.",
"Thank you, prêtre. We have to go now, thank you for everything.",
"Wait! Take me with you! I want to get away from this damned city. Plus, if I go with you, the guards will certainly believe that you are the priests. So what do you say?",
"Alright, you can join us. Guide us prêtre.",
"No, sorry we can't use an obese priest, but thanks for the disguises.",
