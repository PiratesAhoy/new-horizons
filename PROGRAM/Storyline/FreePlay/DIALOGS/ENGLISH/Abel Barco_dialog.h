"You're right.",
"So, give me the ransom, Seсor.",
"Hold on my friend! I want to see her husband before.",
"No, mate. You give me the ransom first and I'll accompany you to the place where he is.",
"Alright, let me explain you. I'm not here to pay. If you want to live you're going to tell me where he is right now!",
"Are you jocking! Damn it! Go to Hell!",
"Stop! You won. Let me alive and I'll tell you where you can find him.",
"That's better. So?",
"He is imprisoned in a house near #sTortuga# dock. You cannot miss it. The door is always guarded by two men.",
"Who is the leader of them?",
"A French pirate, Captain Robert Acre. He has spend his last years kidnapping wealthy people in the Caribbean.",
"Well, I'm going to stop his business. About you, I hope you aren't lying. Otherwise, I will come back and kill you definitively. Now, go away!",
