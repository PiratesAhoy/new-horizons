"To the devil with you! I'm trying to enjoy my drink and you're in the way of my light.",
"Easy there! Keep drinking, I have other things to do.",
"Hold on! I just want to talk, and there may be some money in it for you.",
"Well, what do you want to talk about that may involve money?",
"I'm told you've seen a Mayan temple on this island. Is this true?",
"Yes, and I barely got away from it alive. Many of my crewmates didn't. So if you want me to take you to it, you're wasting your time. And mine.",
"Pity, that's exactly what I was going to pay you for. How about if you get me somewhere near but out of sight of the Indians?",
"Alright, I'll lead you to within easy walking distance of the temple, no further.",
"So be it. Of course, you won't be paid as much as if you were to lead us the whole way. How about 100 gold?",
"How about 500 gold, paid in advance, or you can find your own way!",
"500 gold it is, then. But be warned, if you double-cross us, you'll wish you were facing the Indians instead of me!",
"I don't have 500 gold on me right now. Wait here, I'll get it one way or another.",
"Well? Do you have 500 gold for me?",
"First we need to sail to Cape Francos. I trust you can find your way there?",
"Don't worry, we'll find it. You just be ready to guide us inland.",
"Alright, this looks like the right beach. Follow me. Don't break away or double back, or you'll lose sight of me and get lost.",
"Understood. You lead, we follow.",
"From here you just continue along that path. You'll know when you've reached the temple because there'll be an arrow sticking out of your chest.",
"Don't underestimate us. But you've done what was agreed. Return to the ship. When I get back, I'll take you wherever you want to go next.",
"... the idiot's dead with half a dozen arrows in #spronoun# chest. The ship is moored at the beach. All I need is a few strong lads to join me, then we take her and the sea's ours! Who's with me?",
"I'm interested. Seeing as I have experience with the ship in question.",
"You! But you're...",
"Not dead, no. I warned you not to double-cross me. We'll settle this the pirates' way! Draw your sword!",
