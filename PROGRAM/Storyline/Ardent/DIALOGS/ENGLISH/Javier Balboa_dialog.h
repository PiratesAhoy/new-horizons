"You won't get away with it. I shall hunt you down with all the resources at my disposal!",
"Good for you! Hold onto that thought, it will help stop you from doing something rash. Because right now there's either the sad ending where everyone dies or the happy ending where everyone lives. It's your choice, Excellency.",
"Very well. Guards - stand down, let the villain pass. And you! If any harm comes to ",

"That won't work. I'm a pirate and so are my crew. They'll just pick a new captain - one who has not promised not to harm ",

" again is to pay 100,000 gold.",
"That's impossible! No, let me explain. #sSantiago# is short of money. Why do you think I arranged for the marriage of ",

" And the recent loss of a payroll ship to pirates hasn't helped. All I can offer now is 40,000.",

"Your offer is not too bad, all things considered. Very well. Tonight you'll send Grigorio Formoselle to Playa de Sierra Maestra with the money and two guards.",
"Sorry, that's not enough. Try to arrest me and see what happens!",
"How do I know that you won't just take the money, kill Grigorio and the guards, and leave?",
"Because your fort covers the beach. You need to trust me that I'll return ",
" safely, and I need to trust you that you'll order the fort to hold its fire if I do. Without at least that level of trust, this won't end well for either of us.",
"Very well. We have a deal. Tonight, Grigorio, I shall give you the money to take to the beach. With the escort that you suggested, Capitán. You had better not betray that trust.",
"Till tonight, then.",
"You dare show your face here again? I have been looking forward to this. I have taken fencing lessons from the best masters. Now I shall have my revenge in person!",
"Suit yourself. You're not the only one whose skill with the sword has been improving. Let's end this!",
"Yes, to try to make peace. Please, read this letter from ",
"Hmm... How did you know about the puppy?",
"I didn't. I asked ",
" to include something personal which I couldn't possibly know, as a sign that the letter was written freely and not under any duress.",
"I see. Of course, this ruins my plan for the arranged marriage and the money it would have brought. But if I'd only known that ",
" felt so strongly! Very well, if that's truly what ",
" wants, so be it.",
" wants, so be it. Of course, this does not change your standing with Spain. But for now you may leave in peace.",
"Thank you for your understanding. I'm sure ",

", I expect the highest standard of behaviour from you.",
"I won't be joining your navy, but I will try to be worthy of ",
"Good! Now, let us return to the residence. There will be a suitable celebration.",
"I'm sure we'll enjoy it. <Thinks: Joining the crew in the tavern would probably have been more fun, but I'd better keep the father-in-law happy.>",
"Grigorio will show you to the dining hall. Enjoy the reception!",
"Thank you. <Thinks: probably boring people, boring food, and not a drop of decent rum.>",
"Well, #sname#, how did you like the reception?",
"To be honest, the company was not as lively as that which my crew probably found in the tavern, and I'd have preferred rum to whatever gassy wine that was. But the food was superb!",
"Yes, I noticed you dining rather well. And if that had been rum, the amount you drank would have put you on the floor and unavailable. Well, it's late now. I believe you know the way to the bedroom?",
"Yes, though it's a difference to be going there honestly. Goodnight!",
"I trust the night was pleasant for both of you?",
"Yes, thank you.",
"And now to business. By way of a wedding present, I'm pleased to be able to offer you a Letter of Marque on behalf of His Most Catholic Majesty King Carlos II.",
"And now to business. By way of a wedding present, and as you are already in Spain's service, I offer you this sword and armour.",
"Thank you, your Excellency - most generous.",
"Thank you, your Excellency, but I'm afraid I can't accept a Letter of Marque from Spain at the moment.",
"You have returned, and with ",
". But I am surprised. I understood from #sname#'s letter that #spronoun# had chosen to leave me.",
"So! You are back, and with ",
"! What have you been doing to #spronoun#?",
"Well...",
"Well! A pirate with a soft heart?",
"We're not all black-hearted money-grubbers, you know.",
"Out of the question! I can't have #smy_gov_kid# marrying a pirate. Unless, that is, you are willing to give up piracy, now and forever.",
"Is that all that stands in our way? I'm sure I can find some other way to make a living.",
"No, that's not all. The marriage to the house of Downing was to secure a trade deal which would have brought a lot of much-needed wealth to #sSantiago#. If ",
" is to marry you then that will be lost, so you will need to make up some of the loss. The sum of ",
" should suffice.",
"Can I do those the other way round, Excellency? I know only one way to make that sort of money in a reasonable time.",
"That is not a problem, Excellency. I have that amount already.",
"Not a chance! Sorry, but marrying #syour_gov_kid2# is not worth that much money.",
"I hope you are thoroughly ashamed of what you have done here today. Now get out of here before I decide just how angry to become!",
"I'm not the one using my own child to make money. Goodbye!",
"You could get a Letter of Marque from Spain or any of her allies. If then you confine your raiding to French ships then it is not piracy. But, provided you do not harm the interests of Spain, and I do not learn what you have been doing, then very well. Return when you are ready to accept my conditions.",
"I look forward to returning, then.",
"Well? Have you enough money and are you ready to give up being a pirate?",
"Not yet, Excellency.",
"Here is the money you asked for, Excellency. I hereby end my career as a pirate.",
"Excellent! This will be well spent for the benefit of the town, I assure you.",
"Don't tell the people where you got it. I don't want them treating me like some sort of saint and you don't want them to know you got the money from a pirate.",
"From a former pirate, I hope you remember! And now I must make preparations for the wedding. Have you anyone in mind as your escort?",
"I shan't need an escort, Excellency.",
"No, I haven't picked anyone yet.",
"Have you chosen your escort yet?",
"As you wish. The preparations will take a few days. Go and book a room in the tavern. You'll need to pay for the first night but I'll cover the rest of the cost. Then proceed to the church.",
"Most generous, Excellency. I shall make sure that I am ready for the big day.",
"Aren't you forgetting that you are already married?",
"Oh. Err, yes, well. Sorry about that.",
"What the devil...?",
"Grigorio - get the best physician. No matter the cost, the best! And you - get out there and find who did this!",
"But ",
"... will be cared for. You can do nothing here. But you may be able to do something out there. Now go!",
"If I find the assassin, I'll rip him to shreds.",
"No you won't. We need him alive. He must tell us who hired him and why.",
"I'll try, but if it's him or me that dies, it's him.",
"Well done, soldier. You may go. Now, ",
", you'll be happy to learn that the physician reports the bullet did not hit anything vital. ",
" will recover fully in a few days. What of the assassin?",
"He did not survive the fight, Excellency. But he was carrying this.",
"A ring. So?",
"I'm not sure of its significance.",
"It is the personal signet ring of ",
". I carried its twin when I delivered a letter to ",
"So, ",
" probably hired the assassin. Why?",
"Jealousy, perhaps. If ",
" can not marry ",
", #spronoun# may simply want to prevent anyone else from doing so.",
"I will need to consider an appropriate form of retaliation. In the meantime, ",
" is resting and should not be disturbed. We can find a room for you to stay until #spronoun# is well.",
"Thank you, Excellency.",
"Good morning, ",
". As you see, ",
" is recovered.",
"I am so glad to see that!",
"Hmm... Indeed you did renounce piracy, and England is still our ally. But we have genuine grievance against ",
"Hmm... I can not condone such flagrant piracy against England, which is still our ally. But we have genuine grievance against ",
". I shall issue a Letter of Reprisal which authorises you to engage this specific convoy only. Do not try to use it as cover for attacks on any other English ships!",
"Understood, Excellency. I may attack the convoy but all other English ships are to be left in peace, as are those of Spain's other allies.",
"And ",
"'s safety is your personal responsibility. I probably can't prevent #spronoun# from sailing with you, but if any harm comes to #spronoun#, don't think of showing your face here again.",
"Be assured, Excellency. If any harm comes to ",
", your grief will be matched only by my own, and that has nothing to do with your threat.",
"All this reminds me. I had planned to give you this Letter of Marque as a wedding present, but forgot about it when ",
" was shot. It means you can attack Spain's enemies without being considered a pirate.",
"Thank you, Excellency! I - in fact, we - will put this to good use.",
"Ah, ",
", you are back. Did you attack ",
"'s convoy?",
"We did indeed. ",
" will probably tell you all about it in detail. The short form is, we tracked the convoy to #sWillemstad#. We told the governor you'd sent us to rescue ",
", who we said was a prisoner on one of the ships.",
"And he believed this?",
"He didn't believe me. ",
" was more convincing.",
" persuaded the governor that #spronoun# was a prisoner on one of the ships? I am confused.",
"The good news is that the governor of #sWillemstad# was happy to help.",
"Yes, he probably thinks I owe him a favour. I shall need to write to him to thank him. Since you seized that ship in my name, it would be appropriate if you give it to me, then I can send it to him as a gift.",
"But...",
"Don't feel too bad. You still have the other ships. And their cargoes. You'll still do well out of this.",
"I suppose so. And it will be good to get back to my own ship.",
"What an interesting idea! I shall need to consider what sort of trade could benefit both our colonies, but the principle is certainly sound. I should have something by tomorrow.",
"Which leaves us with the rest of the day off.",
"Good morning, ",
". I have formalised a trade proposal for the attention of Governor #sdutch_gov#. Perhaps you would be good enough to deliver it?",
"Yes, I should be able to do that.",
"Indeed not! We should certainly make this trade offer as soon as possible.",
"I suspect that is not quite what ",
" meant by 'opportunity'. But I have no objection. If #spronoun# proves a capable captain, I may give #spronoun2# other ships to command in future. We shall leave at once.",
"Important business, ",
"We have completed your mission to #sWillemstad#. Your letter, backed up by ",
"'s diplomatic skill, was well received. ",
" will send more communications in future to discuss the financial details but he agreed to the principle of your trade agreement.",
"Excellent! You have both done well. And it seem I was wise to trust ",
" to your care.",
"The care has not been entirely one way. Apart from being a charming companion, #spronoun# has truly proven to be a capable officer.",
"The care has not entirely been one way. #spronoun# has proven to be a most capable officer.",
"However, you do not appear to be in command of that ship. ",
"Please resume command of the ship you seized in #sWillemstad# port, or at least some other Heavy East Indiaman, then we can talk further.",
"You have returned. But where is ",
"I am sorry to have to tell you that #spronoun# has been killed. If it is any consolation, #spronoun# died while valiantly fighting the enemies of Spain.",
"No, it is not much consolation. But I believe ",
" would not want me to punish you, and I will respect that.",
"Thank you for that, Excellency. Truly I am sorry. I can only regret that I was not quick enough to first kill the enemy who instead killed ",
"However, your presence can only remind me more of this tragedy. Now go, please.",
"Yes, of course.",
"Why are you here? You know that I hold you personally responsible for the death of ",
". Now get out!",
". You are no longer welcome in the service of Spain. Now get out!",
"Very well. Goodbye.",
"You continue to plague me with your presence! So be it. From now on Spain regards you as an enemy of the state, to be hunted like a common criminal. Get out before I have the guards arrest you!",
"I'm leaving!",
"I can see by your expression that you have bad news, ",
"Excellency, I'm sorry to have to report that ",
" has been kidnapped.",
"What happened?",
" accepted a place as an officer aboard my ship, yet some unknown men managed to grab #spronoun#.",
" wanted to be released at #sIsla Muelle#, which I did, but when I returned to visit #spronoun#, one of the citizens told me how #spronoun2# had been taken by armed men.",
" Have you received a demand for ransom?",
"No, ",
". Your report is the first I've heard that ",
" has been taken.",
"Then the motive wasn't money. And we have no clue as to who is behind it. I shall contact some, er, 'associates' - perhaps one of them will brag about having done it, or perhaps one of them will have some idea who did it.",
"! You are back! You have no idea how worried I was when I learned of your abduction.",
"This is an outrage! I will have to consider a suitable retaliation against ",
"As for your reward for returning ",
" to me, I offer you this sword and armour.",
" to me. I represent His Most Catholic Majesty King Carlos II in this colony and am authorised to grant you amnesty for all past crimes against Spain, as well as a Letter of Marque which will permit you to legally attack any ship belonging to an enemy of Spain.",
" to me. I represent His Most Catholic Majesty King Carlos II in this colony and am authorised to grant you a Letter of Marque which will permit you to legally attack any ship belonging to an enemy of Spain.",
"Thank you, Excellency. The reward is most welcome.",
"! What are you doing back here, and with ",
", who kidnapped you? Has #spronoun# harmed you or threatened you?",
"You have betrayed Spain, you have betrayed #sromance# and you have betrayed me! Now you will pay in full for your treachery.",
"Uh-oh...",
"And thank you for that trust. But now it would probably be best if ",
" remains here at home with you.",
"Excellency, I have grave news concerning #sSantiago#.",
"Oh? What news is that, ",
"You have probably heard that #sRedmond# has been captured by France. They now plan to invade here.",
"We probably have a little time. I will send word to our admiral in #sHavana# to prepare a defence plan. And you can do your part.",
"Me? How?",
"Whatever the French are planning, they are probably planning it in the naval building in #sPointe a Pitre# on #sisland_Guadeloupe#. It would help our defence if we knew what they were planning.\nKnowing your talent for, shall we say, getting in and out of places you are not supposed to be, I can think of nobody better to get those plans.",
"Very well, I shall see what I can do.",
"Alright, but there will be expenses...",
"Excellent! Be as quick as possible, if you please. The French will undoubtedly want to consolidate on #sisland_Redmond# first, but once they are ready, it is not far from #sRedmond# to #sSantiago#.",
"Yes, I suspected you might say that. Alright, there will be a reward of suitable value to whatever you bring back. But be quick, as what you bring back will be useless if the French arrive here before you.",
"Then I leave for #sisland_Guadeloupe# as soon as possible.",
"I have been to the naval building in #sPointe a Pitre#. These documents may interest you.",
"Well done, ",
". As a reward, please accept this award, the Cross of Santa Isabella, for your valour in infilitating the enemy's headquarters and obtaining these. ",
". As a reward, here are 5000 piastres. ",
"Now, please take the documents to the admiral in #sHavana#. He will certainly be able to make use of them.",
"Thank you, Excellency. I shall leave for #sHavana# at once.",
"Hold on a moment! I have important news about #sromance#.",
"You think to ransom #smy_gov_kid2# a second time? After #spronoun# married #svillain#, I have heard nothing from #spronoun2#. Now you have returned, the reason is obvious. But you will not be paid again!",
"I tell you, it was not I who held #sromance# captive this time! Let me fetch #spronoun2# - #spronoun# is on my ship now. Then #spronoun# can explain in person.",
"Very well. If you can produce #sromance#, and if #spronoun# gives me a good reason, you can live. Otherwise you will not leave #sSantiago# alive.",
"Then I shall fetch #spronoun2# at once.",
"So! You were lying, as I suspected. You return, still without #sromance#. Whatever you have done to #spronoun2#, I shall now avenge!",
"As you wish. Prepare to meet my sword and your maker, in that order!",
"! Why are you in the company of this #sperson# who kidnapped you? Has #spronoun# threatened you again?",
"What sort of revenge?",
"Hmm. Well, so long as family honour is restored, I shall not pursue the matter further. As for you, Capitán ",
", although your crime of kidnapping #smy_gov_kid2# should be punished, your subsequent action as related by #sromance# balances it out. You may leave in peace.",
"I should also say that #sromance# was very useful as an officer aboard my ship, and if #spronoun# agrees, I would like that to continue.",
"Thank you, Excellency. It was my pleasure to return #sromance# to you safely.",
"In that case, I will have to give you an amnesty, Capitán ",
". That way, #smy_gov_kid# is not sailing with an enemy of Spain. Do not make an enemy of Spain again!",
"Thank you, Excellency! I shall confine my attentions to enemies of Spain.",
"Well, if that is what #sromance# truly wants, so be it. Be sure to look after #spronoun# - #spronoun3# safety is now your responsibility!",
"Thank you, Excellency. You can rest assured that #sromance# will be safe with me.",
"Wait! Let #sromance# explain!",
"Oh? I have received a letter from #svillain# saying that you have been unfaithful to #smerch_kid_pronoun2#. Apparently ",
" broke into #smerch_kid_pronoun3# house, murdered some of #smerch_kid_pronoun3# staff, and stole you away.",
"Exactly so. You have always been headstrong, #sromance#, but never dishonest to me. <Rips up letter> So much for that. #svillain# must be made to pay, both for your treatment and for that piece of nonsense.",
"Out of the question! I can't have you involved in piracy, #sromance#! Unless... I have a proposal for you, Capitán ",
". You will accept a pardon and Letter of Marque from Spain. You will become a privateer in the service of Spain",
". You will accept a Letter of Marque from Spain. You will become a privateer in the service of Spain",
". As we have grievance against #svillain#, I shall issue a Letter of Reprisal which authorises you to attack this convoy. But England is still our ally. You may not attack any other English ships, nor any ships belonging to Spain or her allies.",
"If you agree, you may proceed with your plan. If not, #sromance#, you will go back to #svillain#. And you, Capitán, will go back to prison, where you will not have time to plot another escape. So, do you agree?",
"It's almost as if you're putting me on a leash, Excellency. But given the alternative, I can live with that. I accept your deal.",
"Very well. #sromance#, you will make sure Capitán ",
" abides by this agreement. Capitán ",
", the safety of #smy_gov_kid2# is now your personal responsibility. Make sure no harm comes to #spronoun2#!",
"Have no fear, Excellency. I have a feeling this is going to work out very nicely for all of us.",
"Excellency, I have reason to believe that the French are going to attack #sRedmond#. The attack will be led by a #stype#, the '#swarship#'.",
"Yes, I have received a similar report from #sadmiral# in the #sHavana# admiralty.",
"After conquering #sRedmond#, I believe the French intend to attack #sSantiago#.",
"Very likely. An attack on #sisland_Cuba# would be a logical next step, and we are the nearest colony to #sisland_Redmond#.",
"\nBut if the French can be stopped at #sRedmond# then there will be no threat to #sSantiago#. I have a proposition for you. The risk will be high and so will the reward.",
"I'm very interested in that sort of proposition!",
"Good. It is this. You are to sail to #sRedmond# and provide whatever assistance you can in its defence.",
"You have to be joking! I'm liable to end up facing the '#swarship#'! Even the English navy would think twice about that - I'm not even going to think once about it!",
"That probably means I'll be up against the '#swarship#'. It would be the biggest prize I've ever taken - very well, I'll do it!",
"You underestimate yourself,",
". I am well aware of your exploits, and your abilities. In my opinion, although the '#swarship#' is a formidable enemy, you probably have a better chance than the English navy.",
"\nAfter all, as I recall, you even challenged the might of our fort. Yes, I now know full well who took my payroll ship some time ago. But that is in the past and I hold no grudge, merely recall it as an example of your ability.",
"I wish I shared your confidence. However, if the reward matches such a risk, I'll do it.",
"Excellent! If you do indeed face the '#swarship#' and prevail, I can assure you the reward will be appropriate.",
" To help you, I will assign two of our fast galleons to your command. Note that they are specifically for this action - do not try taking them on a cruise of your own!",
"Thank you. I shall need them if I meet the '#swarship#'. ",
"Very well, I shall sail for #sRedmond# as soon as possible.",
"Your report is out of date, ",
". #sRedmond# has already fallen to the French. The '#swarship#' was indeed instrumental in the attack on the fort.",
"Then their next target will be #sSantiago#.",
"\nThat being so, I would like you to sail to #sHavana#. Go to the admiralty and speak to #sadmiral#. He may need your services.",
"I'll see what he has to offer, but I expect to be paid.",
"Don't worry about that. If you can assist in the defence of my town, I personally guarantee that you will be suitably rewarded.",
"In that case, #sHavana# has just become very interesting. I shall sail there at once.",
"Welcome back, ",
"! News of your victory at #sRedmond# has already arrived here.",
"Yes, I don't know who was more surprised - the French admiral or the English governor.",
"The governor of #sRedmond# has presumably rewarded you for your action. But as the defeat of the '#swarship#' removes the threat of a French attack on #sSantiago#, it is only right that I should show my gratitude on behalf of my town as well.\n",
"From what I gather, the marriage between #svillain# and #sromance# has been annulled by the church. #sMy_gov_kid# is therefore free to marry again.",
"The death of #svillain# frees #sromance# to marry again.",
" Perhaps you would wish to marry #spronoun2#?",
"Yes, I would be happy to take #sromance# as #smy_spouse#, if it is also what #spronoun# wishes.",
"No, I am not the marrying kind.",
"As you wish. ",
"Your courage and skill at sea would go well with a Letter of Marque. As well as adding legitimacy to your further actions against France, it will bring rewards of its own, such as glory and estates.",
"I already have a Letter of Marque from England.",
"Yes, that sounds like it could benefit me.",
"No, I do not wish to be tied to Spain in that way.",
"There is no conflict of interest there. Spain and England are allied against France. You would gain all the benefits from Spain in addition to gaining the same benefits from England.",
"And it means I am not so closely tied to England. Very well, I accept.",
"Nevertheless, I do not wish to serve Spain.",
"Excellent! I look forward to reading further reports of your exploits, ",
"Very well. Should you reconsider, you can always buy a Letter of Marque from any governor of Spain.",
"I am pleased to grant you a promotion to the rank of ",
", as well as ",
" acres of land to your estate.",
"Please accept these 100000 piastres as evidence of that gratitude.",
"Though this comes hard to me, I hereby forgive you for your part in the death of #smy_gov_kid2#, #sromance#.",
"Thank you. ",
"Now, if you will excuse me, I must leave. Goodbye, Excellency.",
"Excellency, the French have attacked and captured #sRedmond#.",
"Excellency, I have been tasked by #sadmiral# to evacuate you from #sSantiago#. He does not have sufficient ships to defend the town against the '#swarship#'.",
"Even so, I shall not leave. I shall remain here to lead the defence of my town.",
"Excuse me, Excellency, but I must insist. The admiral has promised to pay me for getting you out of here, and I intend to collect.",
"The only way you can compel me to leave is by force. In that case, either I will kill you, or you will kill me and fail your mission. Either way, you will not receive anything from #sadmiral#.",
"Your courage is admirable, but it seems that I have wasted my time, and yours.",
"Not necessarily. Take #smy_gov_kid2#, #sromance#, to safety.",
"Not necessarily. Keep #smy_gov_kid2#, #sromance#, safe.",
" We may yet succeed in defending #sSantiago#.\nPerhaps the fort will drive the French away, or perhaps we will defeat them in the fort or in the town itself.\nIn that case, when this is over, bring #sromance# home safely and you will be rewarded.",
"Very well. Good luck in your defence. #sromance#, follow me, please.",
"Very well. Good luck in your defence. #sromance# is certainly safer aboard my ship than here when the French arrive.",
"Perhaps so. But I imagine you will find something to keep you busy, so it only remains for me to wish you luck in whatever you plan to do next.",
"Thank you, and good luck in defending #sSantiago#.",
"Your presence will have little effect on the battle here, #sromance#. If we win, you can return. If not, it will be for you to carry on the fight elsewhere. You can not do that if you fall beside me.",
"I would not have believed it possible had I not seen it myself, ",
"You were watching?",
"Yes, I was in the fort, preparing to lead its defence. ",
"Even with the extra galleons we lent you, ",
"I expected the '#swarship#' to brush you aside, then assault the fort. But by defeating the '#swarship#', you prevented that and saved #sSantiago#.",
"Then perhaps #sSantiago# will be suitably grateful?",
"Indeed so. ",
"For one thing, that more than atones for any crimes you have committed against Spain in the past. ",
"Although ",
"Also, although ",
"this comes hard to me, I hereby forgive you for your part in the death of #smy_gov_kid2#, #sromance#. ",
"And please accept these 100000 piastres as evidence of the gratitude of #sSantiago# for your part in its defence.",
"Please accept these 100000 piastres as evidence of the gratitude of #sSantiago# for your part in its defence.",
"Thank you, Excellency.",
"That is not all. ",
"And finally, I have one more offer if you are interested.\n",
"In that case, you will be pleased to know that #sromance# has already spoken to me on this matter, and would be happy to marry you.",
"Let me not be the one to bring #spronoun2# unhappiness. You can tell #sromance# that I am willing to marry #spronoun2#.",
"Then that is settled. Have you a suitable wedding ring?",
"I have this fine gold ring set with an emerald.",
"I have this beautiful gold ring set with sapphires.",
"No, I have nothing suitable.",
"Yes, that would be a perfect ring.",
"I'm glad you approve.",
"In that case, allow me to present this ring. It was given by my mother to my father when they married, and it would be fitting if it were to be used for the marriage of #smy_gov_kid#.",
"It is magnificent. It would be my honour to present that ring to #sromance#.",
"I shall consider it.",
"And now I must make preparations for the wedding. Have you anyone in mind as your escort?",
"#svillain# was a traitor to England, and therefore to the Alliance. Any loyal citizen of Spain can only rejoice at #spronoun3# death. You are a loyal citizen, are you not, Father?",
"Indeed. #sSantiago# can afford to pay for the physical cleaning of the floor. And I can think of no better way to purge the building of the stain of death than to celebrate life with a wedding. Aren't we lucky there is one waiting to be performed? Shall we proceed, Father?",
"Have you any news of particular interest to me?",
"It may interest you to know that ",
", the admiral in #sHavana#, requires a commander of exceptional ability for a special mission. In view of your defeat of the '#swarship#', I will be writing a letter to him recommending you for this mission.",
"Thank you, Excellency. I shall sail to #sHavana# to find out more about this mission.",
