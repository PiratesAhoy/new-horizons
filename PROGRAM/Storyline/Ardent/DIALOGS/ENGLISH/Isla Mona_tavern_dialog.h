"My name is ",
", and I'm definitely not interested in what you're serving. I want some answers.",
"How can I help you?",
"I need information.",
"I'm looking to hire some sailors for my crew.",

"At this hour? All the sailors will be at home, or passed out somewhere. \nIf you're looking to hire, you should wait until morning. You might rent a room here in the meantime.",
"Do you have a vacant room?",
"Maybe later. Let me ask you about something else.",

"Don't bother. I was just leaving.",
