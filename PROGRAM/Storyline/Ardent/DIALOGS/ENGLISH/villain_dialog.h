"Yes? Have you business here, ",
"No, I must have walked through the wrong door. I'll see myself out.",
"Get out! You have already disgraced yourself here. Leave, or do I need to have you thrown out?",
"Relax, I'm leaving.",
"Oh, look.  Another vagabond.",
"My name is ",
" and I'll have you know I'm no vagabond, I'm a sea captain!",
"Oh look, a vagabond with a ship. I suppose you've come to ask for a job?",
"As it happens, yes. Have you any work which requires a ship?",
"It's your lucky day, vagabond. This letter needs to go to ",
" of the governor of #sSantiago#. Deliver it, then bring the answer to me and you will be paid.",
"You may consider the letter as good as in ",
"'s hands already.",
"Well? Did you deliver the letter?",
"Not yet. I shall sail for #sSantiago# soon.",
"Yes. ",
" is looking forward to the wedding.",
"Not quite. A servant insisted on taking the letter and delivering it himself.",
"Yes, but you're not going to like the answer. ",
" does not seem to like you much and dreads the day of the wedding.",
"No, a servant wanted to take the letter from me, which I would not allow.",
"You lie! I do not know what you have really done with the letter but you certainly have not delivered it. Begone and never visit this house again!",
"Where did you hear that? Never mind - you certainly can't have heard it from my ",
" in person. You have failed my trust. Now get out of here!",
"Hah! That is the one thing you could have said which shows you can be trusted. I knew ",
" would not let a stranger near my dear ",
". Here is your reward. And now I have another letter for you to deliver. Also, take this ring. It marks you as my trusted agent. Show that to ",
" and he will let you through, or he'll answer to me! Deliver this one in person and bring back the reply.",
"Thank you for trusting me with this mission. You may rely on my discretion.",
"Ah, you have returned, ",
". Did you manage to deliver the letter this time?",
"Yes, but I'm afraid ",
" does not seem happy about the wedding.",
"No matter. I will soon persuade ",
" to change ",
" mind. Meanwhile, here is your reward. Now, return my ring and be gone. I don't need you any more.",
"Here, take it. It doesn't look all that valuable anyway. Goodbye.",
"Your face seems familiar. Have we met before?",
"No, #stitle#.",
"I am almost certain I know you from somewhere. Where could it be?",
"It can not be, #stitle#. I would certainly remember meeting such a distinguished person as you.",
"Quiet and respectful! I like that! Perhaps you bear a resemblance to one of the many vagabonds who visit my house seeking employment. But you can not be one of them if you are a captain of France.",
"Indeed not, #stitle#.",
"Welcome to my new home, ",
"! As you can see, France rewards her friends well.",
" And my dear ",
", now would be a good time to leave that fool and come back to me, where you belong.",
"Then consider this. France's next target is #sSantiago#. I could be persuaded to give your father safe refuge here. It is up to you to do the persuading, ",
"Thanks for the warning. We'll be sure to pass it on to Governor ",
". With its defences alerted, #sSantiago# will not be so easy to capture. And you won't be there to betray it. Draw your sword!",
"Why would I do that? Guards! Arrest this vagabond!",
"Don't get too comfortable. You won't be living here for long!",
"Defiant to the last, aren't you? But it is you who will not be here for much longer. Guards!",
"Coward! Next time face me yourself!",
"Well, well! If it isn't the vagabond who persists in meddling in my affairs. I thought I recognised you on that French ship. ",
", isn't it? You will not stop my plans for #sRedmond# and #sSantiago# this time! What petty mischief are you up to now?",
"Arresting you. There's a reward for bringing you in, dead or alive. Which way do you prefer, ",
"? Or should I say ",
"Arresting me? You seem to forget where you are. Guards! This is an enemy spy! Arrest ",
"I'll deal with you soon enough!",
"Good morning, ",
"! I hear you went for a bit of a walk last night.",
"Yes, it was becoming boring in here. This place just doesn't have the class of #sRedmond# or #sHavana#.",
"#sRedmond#, you say? Funny, that. You're talking to the soon-to-be governor of #sRedmond#. We'll have a word with the governor of #sPointe a Pitre# and have you transferred into my keeping.\nGuards! Make sure this prisoner doesn't escape between here and the town hall.",
"I don't know where you get the idea that anyone in #sRedmond# will let you govern them, but I'll play along for now. This ought to be interesting, one way or another.",
"Excellency, this prisoner has been a nuisance to me and I wish to take custody of #spronoun#.",
"And I shall be pleased to arrange that as my first act as governor of #sRedmond#. Meanwhile, would not the humiliation of being taken to #sRedmond# as a prisoner on #spronoun# own ship be a fitting additional punishment?",
"Come along, ",
". It will be a change for you, travelling as a passenger on my newest ship.",
"Your ship?",
"Oh, did I forget to tell you? My men seized the '#smyship#' while you were in prison. You'll be escorted there.\nI understand the cargo hold is the normal accommodation for prisoners on ships, so I'll see you there soon.",
"So now you are a pirate as well as a traitor!",
"Ah, ",
", welcome to my newest ship.",
"Yes, my men seized the '#smyship#' while you were in prison.\nI understand the cargo hold is the normal accommodation for prisoners on ships, so I'll see you there soon.",
"I trust you are feeling suitably uncomfortable, ",
"I've been in worse places.",
"Yes, you do seem to be at home in unpleasant places. That is probably why ",
" has had a change of heart and has resumed #spronoun3# rightful place by my side.",
"Indeed. But where is ",
"? I did not see #spronoun2# among the other prisoners.",
". And this ship seems familiar. Would it be one of those you stole from my convoy?",
"That convoy was attacked legally under authority of the governor of #sSantiago# as retaliation for what you did to ",
"Ah, yes. Where is #spronoun#",
"That... is not your concern.",
"Oh, but it is. By your expression I would guess something unpleasant has happened to #spronoun2#. Such a pity #spronoun# chose to leave me and go off with you.",
"It was #spronoun3# choice to do anything rather than be with you.",
"And yet ",
"So that's how it is, is it?",
" And now, ",
", what do you intend to do with me?",
"After I have concluded my business with the governor and admiral here, we will sail to #sPort au Prince# to meet up with the '#swarship#'. In due time she will invade #sRedmond#. I shall be the new governor there.",
"You'll have a revolt on your hands within the week, traitor!",
"I agree that some of the people of #sRedmond# are revolting, but they will soon learn the ways of French civilisation.\nAnd they'll accept me, a native-born English #sperson#, from a locally respected family, more readily than a Frenchman.",
"Don't be so sure. They won't take kindly to an English #sperson# who betrays #spronoun2# own country. Even your own father has disowned you.",
"Who cares what you think? The French believe me, which is why they're going to put me in charge.\nAs for my father, he is old and not much longer for this world, after which I shall inherit both the family name and business.\nAnd you will have a fine view of all this from the town gallows.",
"\nMeanwhile ",
" will be there beside me to watch my triumph and your execution. Come, my dear, let us not suffer this fool's company any further.",
"Au revoir, ",
"Again you interfere with my plans, ",
"Yes, ",
". Nice ship you have here. I think I'll take it.",
"You think you can walk into the cabin of one of the most powerful ships of the French navy and live? Guards! We have a stowaway!",
"Call all you like. The ship is already mine. The crew are all either dead or my prisoners. You're next.",
"So be it. You have plagued me for too long already. At least I shall have the pleasure of putting you out of my misery.",
"The pleasure will be all mine.",
"Well done, governor. Your wife is still alive. If you continue to co-operate, she will remain that way.",
"And now, ",
"Welcome, ",
" - drop your weapons or I shall kill Governor #sgovernor#.",
"If I do, you'll kill him anyway.",
"No, I won't. I need him alive to surrender #sRedmond# to me.",
"Who's going to accept such a document? The invasion is defeated. I've seen to that. There is nobody left to enforce your rule here.",
"Damn you, ",
"That's the spirit! It's me you want, so here I am - come and fight!",
"And then Governor #sgovernor# will just order his guards to kill me.",
"No, he won't. Excellency, you'll need to give your word that if #svillain# defeats me, you will give #spronoun2# safe conduct out of #sRedmond#.",
"So be it. ",
", you have crossed me for the last time!",
"How right you are, #svillain#. One way or another, this ends now!",
"Go ahead, kill him. While your blade is stuck in him, you'll be defenceless. I'll cut off your hand. Then I'll cut off other bits and force-feed them to you.",
"You would stand by and let me kill Governor #sgovernor#?",
"Why not? I owe no allegiance to England. You kill him, I kill you, then I loot this place. Then I tell everyone you killed the governor and I avenged him.",
"That assumes that you'll be the one walking out of here, which you won't. You have stood against me once too often. You will not live to do it again.",
"We're not going to agree on who is leaving here upright. So draw your sword and let's find out!",
"I just can't seem to stop myself, #svillain#.",
"I should have known I couldn't trust #sadmiral#. If I want something done properly, I have to do it myself.\nIt is time to end this once and for all. Would you care to fight me, one on one?",
"I wouldn't have it any other way. I've been looking forward to this for a long time. Draw your sword!",
"Stop! I forbid this!",
"I am #svillain#. #sromance# is mine!",
"And I say #sromance# is married to me, for the rest of our lives. If #spronoun# is to marry again, it will be over my dead body!",
"I can agree to that.",
"You heard the priest. Shall we continue this outside?",
"No! This is another of your tricks, ",
"! If we are to fight, it will be here! Now!",
"Incidentally, you had some French prisoners. I've released them, of course.",
"At least I won't have to share my hold with them.",
