"Arrr!",
"Well well, look what the tide washed in! How's the #sbackground#'s life been treating you, ",
"I'm surprised to see you back here, ",
". Word is you quit being a pirate.",
"You have a nerve showing your face here, ",
"! Half the people in here would gladly rip it off if they weren't too busy with their rum. I'd do it myself but I suspect you didn't risk coming here without a reason, so out with it!",
"Not too badly. But I need your help with something.",
"Doesn't stop me looking in on my old mates, does it? Besides, I'm hoping you can help me with something.",
"You're right there. But I've nowhere else to turn. I need help with something.",
"Ask away!",
"Why in the name of all the sea devils would I help you?",
"You tell me. What reason could I give to persuade you to help me?",
"Hmm... I might just have a job for you at that. But first, what do you need?",
"The #skid# of the governor of #sSantiago# has been kidnapped. I was wondering if you had any idea who took #spronoun#.",
"A governor's #skid#? And you didn't kidnap #spronoun# yourself?",
"I did, and you'd be amazed how that turned out. But now someone else has done it and I've got the job of getting #spronoun# back.",
"Alright, I'll put out a few feelers and see what I can drag up.",
" Meanwhile, I have my own favour to ask of you. One of my men, ",
", got himself caught by the French and is stuck in #sPointe a Pitre# prison on #sisland_Guadeloupe#. And you're the great escaper, the first person to get out of #sHavana# prison under your own sail. Perhaps you can get ",
" out as well.",
" In return, you're going to rescue one of my men, ",
", who got himself caught by the French and is now in #sPointe a Pitre# prison on #sisland_Guadeloupe#. And you're the great escaper, the first person to get out of #sHavana# prison under your own sail. So if you have ",
" with you next time you come here, I'll tell you what I found out about your governor's #skid#. If not, you'll be looking for a new face.",
"Alright, sounds like a fair deal to me. #sisland_Guadeloupe#, here I come...",
"Patience, #sladlass#! It'll be a while before my men report anything useful back to me.",
"You're lucky I'm in a generous mood. Be off before you change that!",
"Alright, I'll get on with rescuing ",
"Welcome back! And I see you've brought ",
" with you as well. Now, as for your problem. Someone reported seeing a #sperson# matching the description of your governor's #skid# being brought into #sRedmond# by a gang of armed men.",
"Thanks! I'll see if anyone in #sRedmond# knows anything more.",
"Well, you're back, and with ",
" too. Good. As for my side of the deal, someone reported seeing a #sperson# matching the description of your governor's #skid# being brought into #sRedmond# by a gang of armed men.",
"Nice doing business with you. I'll see if anyone in #sRedmond# knows anything more.",
"Hey, Mary! Someone here you probably want to speak to!",
"Nice lady, is she?",
