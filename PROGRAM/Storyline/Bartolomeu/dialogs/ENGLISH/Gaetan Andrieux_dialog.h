"I can't believe... I can't believe that...",
"What's wrong, mate? Did you see the devil? HA-HA!",
"Yes, I saw him.",
"What? is it a joke?",
"No, it isn't. Many people in this town can confirm it. You don't live here, right?",
"That is true... Now, I'm curious. Can you explain what happened here?",
"Two weeks ago, the town was attacked by a strange ship. Nobody has ever seen a ship like that.",
"What do you mean?",
"The ship emerged from the depths of the sea.",
"What?! You like rum, don't you?",
"No need to smile, captain. I'm not drunk. If you are not interested in my story, you can go.",
"Sorry, go on...",
"Alright, this is how everything happened.",
"Now it's my turn to ask, what's wrong with you?",
"It's about the statuette. You told me he got it near the dock.",
"Right. No one could stay below the water that long. In my opinion, it's a fish not a human.",
"Damn it! he took it.",
"What? You knew there was a statuette in the sea?",
"Humm... Forget it, mate. Thanks for the story but I have much to do.",
