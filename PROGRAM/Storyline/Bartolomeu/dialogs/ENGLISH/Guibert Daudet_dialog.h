"Bartolomeu o Portugues?",
"Yes, Do I know you?",
"I’m an officer with Roxanne Lalliere. I also participated in the Santiago mission, Don't you remember?",
"Ohh... Sorry, I don’t remember you. Happy to meet you er... again. I'm looking for Roxanne, I need to tell her about something important.",
"Something terrible has happened. I, and her crew, don’t know where she is now.",
"What do you mean, what has happened?!",
"Yesterday, Roxanne was kidnapped!! A small group of men carried her off into the jungle. I was with her, we put up a great fight. Unfortunately, I was stunned and couldn’t stop them.",
"Damn it! I knew it was going to happen, but not so soon.",
"I don’t understand. What did you know?",
"I’m quite sure these brigands weren’t interested in your Captain.",
"What, if they weren't interested in her they wouldn't have taken her - you are not making any sense!!?",
"Yes, I see, I believe that they were Spanish mercenaries and were looking for me.",
"That still doesn't explain it, what have the Spanish got to do with it?",
"These men work for the Spanish authorities and have been sent to arrest me. They kidnapped your captain because she’s my best friend. They probably think she can tell them where I am.",
"You maybe right about those men, Captain. Now I think on it, I did note that some of kidnappers had a Spanish accent.",
"No time to waste. I need to start my search right now, she’s in terrible danger. Those mercenaries will use all means to persuade her to talk. Torture, rape, a woman is very easy prey for the like of them.",
"I was already getting the crew ready for the search and rescue of our good Captain. We can help you.",
"Thanks, but not this time. I’ll deal with this alone. One man has a far better chance of saving her than a team. They will just kill her if they get the chance. Wait for my return here in town.",
"What is your plan, we need to know so that if you don't return, we will attack them and take our revenge, slowly and painfully?",
"You said they took her to the jungle. I imagine that they must be at Puerto la Cruz, the only Spanish town of this island.",
"I agree. That town offers them the best protection. But, you will be in danger there, you will be recognized?",
"Don’t worry, I already have a plan. See you soon!",
"Bartolomeu and Roxanne, Thank the Gods, you are back!",
"Indeed. It was a difficult fight, but we won out in the end.",
"BUT, this is the man who attacked me, let me at him, I owe him a few cuts and bruises and maybe a couple of broken bones at least!!!!",
"Indeed, Captain Elting himself. We convinced him to join us, so no... he is on our side now.",
"It's a shame he didn't change sides before our fight, my head would be in much better condition now. I would still like to give him some attention. Anyway, where to from here, what’s your plan?",
"We still have to finalize it with Roxanne and Elting, and No again...you leave Captain Elting alone, he is of far more use to us in good health.",
"Indeed. It wasn’t easy, but we succeeded. Now, I need to find Emilio.",
