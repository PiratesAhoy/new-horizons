"What's going on? What are you doing here?",
"Thanks to God! You saved me. I was marooned by my crew. These traitors left me here without food and water a few days ago.",
"You aren't the most lucky captain of these waters. But who are you?",
"Bartolomeu o Portugues.",
"What? The famous Captain here? Are you joking?",
"No, I swear. Help me and I'll reward you.",
"Have you got gold with you?",
"No, but take me to Captain Morgan in Port Royale, he'll lend me gold to pay you.",
"Humm... You say that but not sure we'll receive the gold. We're Spaniards and we cannot trust in English fighting my country. On the other hand, I know the authorities are willing to pay 100,000 gold coins for your arrest and this reward, I can have it.",
"What!",
"Don't be sad. I'm sure the reception will be warm in #sHavana# ha!ha!",
"Bastards! I won't follow you, I prefer to die here!",
"As you like, the reward is as much valid alive or dead.",
"Give me a blade so that I can defend me!",
"I'm not stupid for giving such gift. My men will deal with you. Prepare to die!",
"We'll see!",
"Don't kill me! I surrender!",
"That's better.",
"I've never seen someone killing two men using swords only with a dagger. People were right when they told you're a good fighter.",
"Next time, you'll be more cautious before provoking someone. From now on, you'll be under my command until I get back my ship again. Weigh anchor, we leave this blasted islet.",
"Done, Captain! the water is loaded.",
"Finally, I didn't know we could be in lack of water before reaching #sisland_Redmond#.",
"Don't worry, Turks island is on the way of #sRedmond#. We ought to arrive there quickly.",
"Let's go now.",
