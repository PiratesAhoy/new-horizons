"Are you Leonardo Corrales? ",
"Yes. Who are you, senõr?",
"Read this letter, you’ll understand better. I’m Bartolomeu o Portugues.",
"Bartolomeu o Portugues?! You are infamous throughout these Spanish islands... So, you work for my Governor.",
"Sometimes. I’m here because I need to find someone.",
"Who’s this someone?",
"A Mercenary working for the Spaniards and looking for me. Do you know him?",
"Only Vice-Admiral Benavides works with these kind of cutthroats.",
"Vice-Admiral Benavides? who is he?",
"He lives in Havana and commands the Navy of Cuba, but above all he rules an intelligence service composed of spies and a group of mercenaries.",
"An important person...",
"Indeed. In fact, he’s more powerful than the Governor of Havana.",
"So, you think a Benavides’ mercenary is looking for me.",
"I think there are two mercenaries looking for you and not just one.",
"What evidence do you have for this?",
"I found out that Nicholas Butcher and Johan Elting had been given the mission to kill a famous Portuguese pirate. Like most people in the Caribbean, I only know one famous Portuguese pirate : YOU.",
"How did you find this out?",
"Before leaving the island a few weeks ago, Nicholas Butcher was in town waiting for Elting.",
"Humm... Do you know where they went?",
"No idea.",
"In #sisland_Conceicao#, my crew was attacked by one mercenary not two. So, I still don’t know if it is Elting or Butcher or both are the enemy.",
"I can’t help you there. But I advise you, if they don’t find you, your friends are in real danger. They will interrogate them about your present whereabouts.",
"I see it. They already kidnapped my best officer. By the way, can you give me any information about these mercenaries, anything might be usefull?",
"Well, Butcher is English and the oldest mercenary working for Benavides. However, the most dangerous is Johan Elting, a Dutch. I heard he was successful in some hard missions like the capture of Oranjstad.",
"It seems he doesn’t have a guilty conscience when killing his own people.",
"I'm not so sure. I heard his behaviour has been more erratic since this operation.",
"Interesting... Thank you for the information. Now, it’s my work to find them. Goodbye!",
