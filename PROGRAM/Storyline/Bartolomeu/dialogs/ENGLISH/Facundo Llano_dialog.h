"Are you looking for anybody, mate?",
"Not really. Can I have a drink with you?",
"Of course, sit down! So, what are you doing on #sisland_Isla Muelle#? I don't remember having seen you before.",
"I don't often visit this town. I'm a merchant, but I rarely trade with Spaniards. Tell me something, I heard a joke about your Governor, apparently he is looking for some indian statuette. Has all his men spread far and wide like King Arthur and the Grail, Ha ha?",
"Oops.. Don't speak so loud. If a soldier hears you talking of this, you will be in real trouble.",
"Why this caution, it is only a statue?",
"I don't know. Some people think the governor doesn't want this rumour spread because the statuette could be important for fighting our enemies. Others think this story is a joke and only discredits his authority.",
"You don't have any opinion about the rumour?",
"No, I don't have any idea if the statuette or idol even exists. You should forget you ever heard this rumour, my friend.",
"You're right. Thanks for the conversation but I have to go now.",
"Oh, I am sorry for putting you off your rum? Well, have a good day and maybe I will meet you again.",
"Maybe. It has been a pleasure to have a drink and a talk, always good!",
