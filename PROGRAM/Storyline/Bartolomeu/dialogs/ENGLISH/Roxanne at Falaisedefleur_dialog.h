"At last, you have returned to me! How are you ",
"Much better now that I have found you again! Roxanne! What is your news since we last met?",
"You are not a good enough to be here talking to me, low life. Get out of my sight if you want to live!",
"All right, don't get your knickers in a twist. I'll come back later.",
"Nothing really important. I continue working for my lovely Governor. My business is improving day after day and he throws great parties.",
"That's good news. Maybe, you'll replace your Governor in a few years Ha-Ha!",
"Maybe we could join forces to do expeditions together. With our two ships, we could accomplish great things and spend some time together!",
"Ah, possibly? Keep talking.",
"For now, I'm not interested. But I am very happy to see you again.",
"Well! Here are the terms! You don't need to provide goods for my crew during our association but you carry out any repairs to my ship. By the way, you don't need to provide Planks, Sailcloth and munitions for my ship as each time we spend a few days here, my crew will resupply my ship!",
"Will I have to pay salary for you and your crew?",
"No, of course not, and my crew will not require food from your rations at sea; but... Take note though! If and when we cease our partnership, all the plunder must be divided into two equal shares and the total must not be less than ",
"Good! We have an accord. When can we set sail?",
"Sorry, but I think I'm able to make expeditions without partner, I don't need your nagging at present!",
"As soon as possible! I want to smell the beautiful perfume of powder and blood! Ah Ah! and the touch of finery and jewels",
"Er.. good, if we need to talk or want to cease our partnership? How do we proceed, I don't want to end up having to fight you?",
"We'll meet here in town in a neutral place, breaking up is always emotional. This port gives good protection from our enemies. ",
"Aye! I hope that our association will remain engraved in the memory of nations as one of the worst of caribbean seas!",
"Here is a good safe anchorage. If we spend a few days here, I will resupply my ship and make some repairs!",
"It would be a good thing to spend time together here with you,",
"We can't stay here! We have to sail away!",
"The time has come to go our separate ways. Our partnership ends now, my friend",
"How many days will we spend here?",
"1 day will be enough",
"5 days spent in a safe place will be very good for our crew moral!",
"I changed my mind!",
"Fine, in that case, the time has come to divide our gold in 2 equal parts!",
"It's time to move on now, captain!",
"You know, I think I will keep all the booty for myself!",
"I changed my mind.. we don't have to separate just yet, there is more to be done!",
". You are my lover, captain and I'll be here in case you wish to sail in er... with me again!",
"I'll think about it my friend. I already miss you and pray that I'll see you again, soon!",
"Son of bitch! you are already dead!",
"We will see",
"Lover boy! What a pleasure to see you alive! A good wind has brought you back to me!",
"Only a friendly visit to catch up with you, Roxanne!",
"I want to organise an expedition with you captain! I have a lot of enemies in these waters, so your ship and your experience will be a help and the plunder will be good, not to mention spending some time with you!",
"With the same terms of previous expedition! Fifty-fifty with a booty of ",
"Of course, we have an accord and our enemies will shiver in their boots!",
"all things considered, it will have to be another time. I will think about it",
"Hoorah, my friend! Let's have a drink to our new expedition! I have been getting stale in this port!",
"Let's have a drink to our gold!",
"You're cheating me, my friend! Have you hidden some gold? If this is all that you have to share, I'm going to keep all the booty for myself and kill you for your incompetence!",
"You believe you'll kill me so easily my little lovely!",
"Every Spaniard alive in this world is my enemy and I've heard that you are a friend of the Spanish crown! You are lucky to be here! As long as you're accepted in Spanish ports, I will have nought to say to you!",
" Aye! One day perhaps!",
" Gold minimum, I will cut your throat, lover!",
" For you and ",
" for me",
" gold minimum to be shared!",
