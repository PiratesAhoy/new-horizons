", friend. I'm",
", I run the local shipyard.",
"Pleased to meet you. I'm ",

"'.",
", ",
". So, what can I do for you, ",
"?",
"I'm just looking to plug up a couple of holes and patch my sails. No questions asked.",
"At the moment, I'm more interested in information.",
"No, I'm just killing time. I thought I might kill some of yours while I'm at it.",
"Well, if you're a captain, my shipyard is at your service.",
"Excellent, ",
". Let's have a look at my ship and see what needs fixing.",
"I appreciate it. At the moment, though, I'd just like to ask you some questions.",
"Maybe next time. I don't need your services right now.",
"What exactly are you interested in, ",
"?",
"Not at the moment, no.",
"Is there anything else I can do for you, ",
"?",
"If you can slap a couple of patches on my tub, I'll be on my way!",
"Thanks, that's it. Farewell!",
"What exactly do you need?",
"My ship is in need of repair. Or maybe I'll just buy a new one if the price is right.",
"I'm feeling the need for a little more firepower. Maybe you can help.",
"I'm fine, thanks.",
"I refuse to trade with a person of your reputation and relations. Now get out, ",
", before I call the guards.",
"Very well.",
"Allright, my dock beside the fort is available for you. If you want I'll tell my dockmaster to tow your ship in there. Only then can I survey the damage and tell you how much time and money it'll take.",
"DOCK BESIDE THE FORT?? Uhh... I just remember that I have... eeh... another pressing business I must attend to first. Goodbye.",
"After closing this dialog, press ENTER to bring up the sail changing interface.",
"Exit",
"I would like to know if you worked on a caravel last month.",
"Humm... Let me think. Recently, I worked a lot... Yes! I remember a new model of caravel!",
"Excellent! I'm looking for her captain. You certainly talked to him?",
"If I am not mistaken, he's English but he doesn't live on this island. It was the first time that I have met him.",
"Do you know his name?",
"I'm not sure... I think I heard his boatswain call him Charles. That's all I know about him. In fact, the repairing was quick. He only stayed two days in the town.",
"So, he doesn't live in this city.",
"No, and I don't think anbody in the town knows him either.",
"Last question : Do you know where he went?",
"I have no idea. I just know he was in a hurry to meet... it's a French name I think... L'Ollonais! he told a crewmember.",
"François L'Ollonais?!",
"I don't know. I just heard 'L'Ollonais'.",
"So you can't tell me where the meeting could have taken place.",
"No, I can't help you with that.",
"Thank you! Your information has been very useful, at least it is a lead.",
"You're welcome. And don't forget if you want a good ship, or quality repairs, we always provide the best!",
"Don't worry, I won't forget. See you soon!",
