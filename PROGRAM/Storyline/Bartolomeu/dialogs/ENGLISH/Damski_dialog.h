"Yes?",
"Captain Damski?",
"Right. What do you want?",
"The Vice-Admiral sent me. You are to provide me with some new kind of Xebec.",
"The ship is for you!!?",
"Indeed. Why do you ask?",
"I understood she would be given to a ranking Spanish captain. You are not Spanish, are you? This is a special ship!",
"I'm Dutch, my name is Johan Elting. Your name is not Spanish either, is it?",
"True, I'm not Spanish. I was a pirate captain till only a few years ago.",
"What are you doing in #sHavana#?",
"I was caught and arrested by the Spaniards.",
"It seems we share the same fate.",
"The Vice-Admiral, somehow he knew I was a good shipwright before becoming a pirate, pressed me into service instead of the gallows, I did not argue.",
"I understand and sympathize.",
"But I'm not here to tell you my life story, lets get down to the business at hand - I have to explain the features of my latest work.",
"She must be a very special ship!",
"Yes indeed, she exceeds the standard in every aspect. The cargo hold is twice the norm, more cannons of a larger caliber.",
"She must be heavier and slower.",
"No, because the hull has been made with a newly discovered timber only found here in the Caribbean. This wood is stronger and lighter than any used in Europe.",
"I'm impressed.",
"You should be... and as well, she is fast and agile. In the right hands she will carry surprise and death to many an unsuspecting foe and bring her Captain and crew glory and fame.",
"I can't wait to see her. Your faith in her is catching.",
"She's in the port waiting for you, Captain. Treat her well.",
"My assigned officer will be there too, no doubt. Thank you for the ship. Farewell Captain Damski!",
"Good evening, Father. I think you made a mistake, I didn't ask you to come.",
"(Elting to Damski) We are not priests, Captain Damski. Don't you recognize my voice?",
"Yes, I've already heard it but I don't remember where.",
"(Elting to Damski) I talked to you in the shipyard when you gave me the 'El Diablo'.",
"Captain Elting?!",
"(Elting to Damski) Himself and the person with me is Captain Bartolomeu.",
"I thought the authorities killed you after your desertion.",
"(Elting to Damski) They tried many times but failed as you can see.",
"What are you doing here?",
"(Elting to Damski) I need your help.",
"What exactly do you want?",
"(Elting to Damski) Do you know anything about an aztec treasure that the Silver Fleet has conveyed?",
"A treasure? No, nothing. How do you know this?",
"(Elting to Damski) A too long story, I'll explain you another day. Nothing about what could have been unloaded from the ships?",
"If in the port a treasure would have been unloaded, be sure people would talk about it.",
"Wait! I could help you.",
"(Elting to Damski) How?",
"I know the Fleet's Captain, Captain Villalobos, must see the Governor tomorrow morning. I'll also be in the townhall. Some of the ships need to be repaired before leaving Havana. It seems they have met a tempest during the voyage.",
"We can confirm. We've even had to call in at #sisland_Khael Roa#.",
"I still need a confirmation of the damages but I bet two weeks for their stay.",
"(Elting to Damski) Humm... The best solution would be to kidnap him after the meeting and before he joins his crew in the port. Without forgetting, we need to be discreet if we don't want all the guards of this town attacking us.",
"I'll leave the townhall before him seeing he'll have another topics to talk to the Governor. I could be with you to warn of his arrival.",
"(Elting to Damski) Alright, I think we have a plan. Can we stay in your house until tomorrow morning?",
"Of course.",
"Thanks!",
"Captain! He's coming but there are two guards with him.",
"(Elting to Damski) Don't worry. I and Bartolomeu will deal with them. Now, return to your work before he sees you with us.",
