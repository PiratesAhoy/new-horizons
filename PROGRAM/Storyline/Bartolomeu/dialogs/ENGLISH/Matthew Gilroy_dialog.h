"Captain, not sailor.",
"Never mind, I have no time for visits. Leave me alone!",
"I came to talk of Charles",
"Charles?! And why?",
"I'm a captain and I'd like to work with him. I've heard you know where he lives. Could you help me to find him?",
"Sorry Matey! But things don't work that way. If Charles is interested in working with you, he'll find you not the opposite. So give me your name and where you usually live, I'll pass these informations on to him.",
"He seems to be a discreet person. Could we instead... do it my way?",
"NO, there are many people who would like to kill him. So, if you don't accept the conditions let me alone. I have other things to do!",
"Humm... I'll think on your proposition.",
