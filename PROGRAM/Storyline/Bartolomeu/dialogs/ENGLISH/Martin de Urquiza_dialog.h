"Who are you?",
"I came to free you.",
"You work for the Governor of #sIsla Muelle#?",
"[THINKS: Let's lie!] Right. Soon, you'll be on #sisland_Isla Muelle#.",
"Thank you! I knew the Spanish Crown wouldn't leave me in the hands of the British Army.",
"Who's the person with you?",
"He's my valet.",
"He must stay here. He could complicate our escape if he comes with us.",
"No way, Captain! He has been working for me for years. I won't abandon him.",
"As you like, but don't count on me to save him if he's in trouble. My mission is to free you, not your valet. Follow me and don't make any noise.",
"But we are in #sTortuga#?! You lied. You don't work for the Spanish authorities.",
"HA-HA! You took your time to understand. Your naivety is endless. Now, shut up, Governor Ogeron is coming.", 
"What did you do to my servant?! You are barbarians!",
"You are stupid, Senor. Because of your behaviour, the valet died. Tell us everything or I bet Montbars will burst your head!",
"Alright! Alright! The gold is hidden in a fort built a short while ago in #sisland_Isla Muelle#.",
"A new fort in #sisland_Isla Muelle#? I've never heard that.",
"Because the fort has been built far from the population.",
"What do you mean?",
"It's built in Aguadilla bay?",
"Aguadilla? Where is the location?",
"On the north west coast.",
"A smart idea. That region is uninhabited. Is the fort well-protected?",
"A whole garrison lives inside, the soldiers are brought direct from Spain and provisioned directly, so only a few nobles on the island know of its existence.",
"And the cannons, how many, what type?",
"That's its problem. The original cannons for the fort were lost in transit during a storm. There are some real cannons but few in number, the rest are fake to scare off any attackers.",
