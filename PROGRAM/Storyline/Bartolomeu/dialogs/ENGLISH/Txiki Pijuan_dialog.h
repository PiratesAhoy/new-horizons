"Awwww. What a headache!",
"Are you sober?",
"I am now. But I can't remember anything I did yesterday. Where am I? And who are you?",
"You are in jail and I am the one who might be able to get you out again. IF you are willing to cooperate.",
"But why am I in jail? I might look like a big bad guy, but I never harm anybody.",
"Actually, that is exactly what you did do. Yesterday you went into the brothel drunk and hurt a woman there.",
"Oh. I am so sorry. Is she alright? Bloody demon rum. I don't know what I do when I'm drunk. But I can't resist a bottle of rum.",
"Never mind about that. Let's get to the pressing matter of getting you out of here. First question: Are you a navigator aboard the 'Santiago'?",
"Yes I am. But I am not going to give you any further information. My captain, Pedro Rivera, will surely get me out of here.",
"Who do you think you're fooling? From what I gather from my sources, he is a ruthless mercenary who doesn't care about anyone. He will probably abandon you without any second thoughts.",
"Perhaps you're right. My captain is not a good man. He is just as likely to leave me here to rot.",
"Yep. So what will it be? I could leave you in here as well. For a jail, it looks kind of cozy. Perhaps you like it in here?",
"Oh no, captain. I will cooperate. Please get me out of here!",
"Glad we got that sorted out. Now here's the deal: I'll get you out of here and you will help me get what I want: Pedro Rivera's ship, the 'Santiago'.",
"The 'Santiago' is anchored at Anse Casse-Bois. She can carry a maximum of 180 crewmembers, but 40 crewmembers left the ship in disgust when the captain took the mission to capture or kill the notorious pirate Pieter Boelen. I rather wanted to leave myself at that point, but the captain wouldn't let me. He said that an officer leaving would set a bad example for the crew.",
"Why did those crewmembers leave anyway? And why did you want to leave as well?",
"Have you not heard of Pieter Boelen? He is one of the worst pirates in the archipelago.",
"You mean he is not good at pirating? Or do you mean he is a bloodthirsty monster or something?",
"No, not at all. He is one of the most successful pirates of them all and he is rather well-respected by almost all other pirates. But he is also said to be quite a gentleman, always helping people in need and never killing anyone if he can help it. The crew who left respected him so much that they refused to try and hunt him down.",
"Interesting. But let's get back to the topic at hand. This still leaves 140 crewmembers aboard the 'Santiago'. It won't be an easy task to take her. And I don't want to lose too many of my own men, either.",
"Can't you forget about all this? Pedro Rivera is a dangerous man and not to be meddled with. He alone is worth 5 crewmembers. He will kill anyone without hesitation. If he sees me with you, I'll be dead within seconds!",
"Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. I have a plan. And you can stay out of the dangerous parts if you feel so obliged. I'll talk to the prison guard to arrange your release now. Goodbye.",
"Wait! Please allow me to be your officer after you captured the 'Santiago'! I love the ship, even though I hate her current captain. I don't want to part with her.",
"Very well then. But you'll need to cut down on the rum. I will not have an aggressive drunk aboard any of my ships. And you will also need to show a little backbone! Courage doesn't seem to be one of your main strengths, I can't have you running away as soon as we try to board a tartane! Think on that while I'm talking to the guard!",
"TXIKI IS FREE! Thank you, MY captain.",
"You are free, yes. And your release cost me a lot of money, so don't try anything funny. Now it's time for you to deliver on your part, so listen closely. You will go back to the 'Santiago' and inform the crew that the innkeeper is giving out free rum tonight to celebrate his daughter's marriage.",
"Free rum! I like this idea! I'll be looking forward to tonight then!",
"You are not allowed anywhere NEAR the tavern. Not with the way YOU behave after drinking. Instead you will stay and ensure that most of the crew leaves the ship. We will meet at the plantation tonight. Now go.",
"Finally! Here you are!",
"What do you mean? I'm not late or anything. Anyway: I've seen some crewmembers running into the tavern, so it seems you have succeeded. How many crew do you estimate are left on the ship?",
"Your plan worked even better than expected. I dare say there are only about 10 hands left. Along with the captain, who, of course, counts for five.",
"Excellent! This should be a piece of biscuit. Follow me, we are going to take the ship!",
"Wait, captain. You promised I would be allowed to stay out of this. Do you remember?",
"I notice you have a lot of faith in our success, don't you? Very well then. You can stay ashore during the boarding. After all, I DID promise that. But we will talk about your lack of courage after the boarding. So beware! Because I WILL succeed!",
"That was amazing, captain. I saw you from this shore and you did a masterly boarding!",
"It's a shame you didn't share this enthusiasm before the boarding. From now on, you will participate in all boardings. If not, I'll fire you.",
"I'm sorry, captain. No rum for me and I do need to participate in boardings. I'm beginning to think I would have been better off with my previous captain.",
"I will have no such talk from you. I might consider that mutinuous. You have seen now that there is nothing to be afraid of when joining in boardings, so you'd better find some courage on short notice! As for the rum: I will allow you to drink rum on occasion, but if you end up drunk and violent again, I will fire you as well.",
"*Hic* You look funny. Oooh I feel sick.",
"I'm the king of the wooooooorld.",
"Aren't you a cute little girl, do you want a lolly?",
"You seem to be too drunk to talk. I'll come back tomorrow.",
