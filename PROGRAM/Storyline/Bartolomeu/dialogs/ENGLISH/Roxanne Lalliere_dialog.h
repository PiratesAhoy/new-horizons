"Matey, are you a Captain?",
"Yes, I am. I've got a barque and a skilled crew. Why do you ask?",
"I'm looking for a Captain willing to take part into an expedition at #sSantiago# of #sisland_Cuba#.",
"An expedition? and who will be the leader?",
"I will, of course.",
"You?? a female!!! This is the first time I've met a woman pirate...",
"Yes me, and yes I am a woman. You had better take that look off your face, otherwise, I will be forced to use my blade..",
"NO! NO! of course, sorry. I'm just amazed. I am curious though, what fate brought you to being a pirate?",
"First, I'm not a pirate, I am a corsair. I have a letter of marque of the French authorities. Second, my personal life is none of your business, so lets just concentrate on the details of the expedition. Savvy?", 
"[Thinks: nice legs for a Corsair and a fiery temper too.] Right, understood, what's the plan.",
"I learned a few days ago that the Spanish authorities are ready to send a galleon full of cacao beans back to Spain. You know the value of such a cargo.",
"A valuable cargo is true, but you're not seriously going to attack a galleon in the port of #sSantiago#.",
"Of course not, It would be sheer folly, I am beginning to wonder about you! In fact, the galleon hasn't arrived yet. It will arrive at #sSantiago# in around two weeks. In the meantime, the cargo is stocked inside two warehouses at the outskirts of the town.",
"And the warehouses are obviously protected...",
"Yes, but if we attack at night, we'll meet only a few soldiers guarding the warehouses.",
"You seem to have prepared the plan in detail. Last question, Are you sure we won't be detected by the enemy before reaching the warehouses?",
"I don't think so. I know a shortcut through the jungle that will allow us to reach the warehouses without entering the town.",
"Well, I'm really interested. And what about dividing the loot?",
"Sixty percent for me and forty for you.",
"Why not fifty percent for each one?",
"I think not. I planned the operation and I am the leader. So it's sixty-forty or nothing!",
"Ok, we have an accord. When do we sail?",
"Today. I have to collect two friends from #sisland_Redmond# for the mission and I wouldn't like to miss such cargo because the galleon arrived before we did.",
"To the ships then. I'll be right behind you.[Thinks: and your beautiful buttocks by the way!]",
"HA-HA! Welcome to my private beach Bartolomeu!",
"Very nice place for a holiday. Are you sure there is a way that joins this beach to the outskirts of town?",
"Absolutely! Go ahead! I follow you.",
"As you like, Roxanne, I'm liking you more all the time!",
"We are near the warehouses. They are just after this rock. When we get closer, we have to kill the soldiers quickly or they will warn the town garrison.",
"True. We cannot take on the garrison and will have to make sure we do nothing to alert them. Move out!",
"Excellent! Now let's get into the warehouses, we need to make sure that there are no soldiers hiding inside.",
"True, they could ambush as we try to remove the goods, or sneak out and warn the garrison!",
"Hoorah, we did it! We can't waste any time in clearing out the warehouses. More Soldiers will come to relieve those we killed at some point.",
"Don't worry, we have enough men to move the goods fast, I would love to see the look on the Spanish when they next come to inspect the goods.",
"Our men have cleared half of the goods. We still have enough time to finish. But where did your second officer go?",
"He was just over there keeping lookout. I must admit, though, I haven't seen Pedro Rivera for ten minutes, Curse him if he has deserted his post!!",
"Time has come for some explanations. Your officer, Pedro Rivera, has nearly cost us our lives and has cost us a small fortune.",
"Indeed, yes, I am furious!",
"You made the right decision Captain. Now this problem is solved, we need to get out of here. The Spaniards will still be after us.",
"You're right, let's go to #sisland_Redmond#. I know the store keeper, he will pay us a good price for the goods.",
"I've just sold the cacao : 45 000 for me and 30 000 gold coins for you.",
"Thanks Roxanne. Sorry again about Pedro Rivera. If he didn't desert his post, we would have earnt twice as much.",
"Forget it! Nobody could predict his actions, I just hope the Spanish caught him and saved us the effort of killing him, he is a complete gutter rat who could be a problem in the future.",
"That's kind of you! And now, what do you going to do next?",
"At the moment, I have no idea. I need to find a good 'Spanish' opportunity HA-HA! And you?",
"I don't know...",
"Wait! I've heard that the Governor of #sisland_Conceicao# is willing to pay a big reward for the arrest of a certain Pirate.",
"Who's this Pirate?",
"I don't know his name. But it could be a good opportunity for you to earn some gold.",
"Interesting. I will ask more details from that Governor.",
"Yes, do that. Well, unfortunately, I can't stay chatting with you any longer, but I'm sure I will meet you again, our little encounter was very good and I look forward to getting together with you again.",
"I think so, the time we had was fun and I know I will want to do it again. See you again, Roxanne!",
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!",
"Guess... BACKWARD!",
"Hello my friend! What are you doing here?",
"Roxanne! Nice to see you again, you are looking good enough to eat. I knew you lived at #sPointe a Pitre# but I didn't hope or think that we would meet so soon.",
"I was repairing my ship in the port today. That's why I am here. And you? I hope you were looking for me, nudge nudge?",
"Yes, I was! I've been thinking recently that we should get together again and embark on a new expedition. Like the old days HA-HA wink, wink!",
"I would like that! I can see us now... What wrong Bartolomeu?! Have you seen a ghost!?!?",
"Follow me Roxanne! I think I saw an old acquaintance.",
"Bartolomeu, stop a minute. Please tell me what is going on?", 
"Oh, sorry, Roxanne. Let me tell you a story. Several months ago I was the proud captain of the best ship I have ever captained, a fast caravel named the 'Santiago'. I was trading with the Buccaneers then, her speed allowed me to escape anyone who would tried to capture me. One day I was in the Buccaneers' Camp at #sisland_Hispaniola#, along with most of my crew, when that rat Pedro Rivera, stole my ship.",
"You mean 'commandeered'. Nautical term. In any case: I've heard a lot about that ship of yours, but wait a second! Pedro Rivera you said. I know this name...",
"Of course you know him. He was the man I abandonned on #sisland_Cuba# for deserting his post and nearly getting us all killed. He obviously joined the Spanish as a mercenary.",
"Right, I remember him now, we should have killed that rat when we had the chance! But I didn't know he worked for the Spaniards.",
"I found that out some time later. He was captured by the Spaniards when we left him, but instead of a hanging, he agreed to work for them as mercenary.",
"I understand now, but that man in the store is not Pedro Rivera. So why do you want him?",
"That's easy: When I and my crew arrived at the shore, the 'Santiago' was just weighing anchor. Four of Pedro Rivera's crew were just about to row back to the ship with some of my unloaded goods. We captured them before they could reach the ship.",
"And this was one of the men you captured?",
"Yes. They couldn't help me find their captain or my ship and they refused point-blank to join my crew, so they were of no use to me and I let them go again. I don't like killing anyone unless I have to.",
"You seem to be quite a nice guy for a pirate, I'm liking you more all the time. Therefore, you think this man might have rejoined Pedro Rivera's crew and might know where your ship is?",
"Right again. I would love nothing better than to stand on the deck of my beloved 'Santiago' once more, the wheel in my hands and the wind and the spray of the sea in my face.",
"I'll talk to the sailor discreetly and try to pry some information out of him. He will recognize you if he sees you, so just wait for me outside, I should be able to use my feminine wiles on him, or if, necessary, my blade.",
"Wiles you say, good idea. I'll wait outside.",
"Ok, that was not as easy as I thought. He quickly became suspicious and I could only get limited information from him - he must be a bit queer.",
"But did you learn anything important?",
"Yes. First, he is a sailor on a ship. But, she is not moored in port?",
"Weird! An ordinary captain would always anchor in port, under the protection of the fort's cannons, he must be hiding something.",
"That was what I thought, too.",
"So you're saying that it is likely he is a crewmember of a pirate or smuggling ship?",
"Indeed. Perhaps even of the 'Santiago'!",
"What else did he say?",
"Despite that he didn't want to give me any details about the ship he did let slip that their navigator is having a good time in the local brothel.",
"Interesting. We should pay a visit to the brothel and see if we can convince that navigator to help us.",
"Ok, let's go to the brothel, but I don't think I really want to go in, my reputation and all, Savvy, you can do the talking.",
"The brothel it is.",
"So, did you have a good time? You were gone a while, what did you find out?",
"I'm surprised at you, a bit jealous are we. The brothel is closed. One of the guests, not a regular, hurt one of the ladies and was taken off to jail. It could be our man. So I'm going to pay him a visit.",
"Did you get in to see him? Was it the navigator we seek? And what about your ship?",
"I managed to talk to him and he indeed is the man we were looking for. I convinced him to help us and he has been very useful so far. What luck, Pedro Rivera is at Anse Casse-bois with the 'Santiago'!",
"That's very good news! So we are going there right now? I can't wait to have a good fight!",
"Steady on, Roxanne! Don't think I'm not in a hurry to meet my good friend Pedro! Of course, he has an urgent appointment with the sharp end of my blade but there are 140 men aboard the 'Santiago'. Are you proposing we take on them all? Just the two of us? I don't think so. We need to use our heads, I don't intend to lose any crewmembers in a fullscale boarding.",
"What's the plan, then. My sword has an itch to scratch.",
"Indeed I do. But it's not going to work without the help of the navigator. He's still in jail, so I need to talk to the governor to get him out of there.",
"Good news or bad news?",
"Both. The bad news is that I had to pay a lot of money. The good news is that it was worth it. The navigator has been freed. I will go see him now in prison and explain to him the first part of my plan. We will go to the tavern afterwards to arrange the second part.",
"I understand your plan now, but do we really need to wait here? We've been out here for hours. Why aren't we going to meet the navigator?",
"I just need to check that the navigator did his part. Otherwise there's no use in trying to take the ship. Follow me!",
"Look at them! They seem to be in quite a hurry. Can't resist the call of free rum!",
"Yes. These drunkards won't know what happened to them when they find out their ship is gone tomorrow. Let's go to the fort now. Pijuan should be there waiting for us.",
"That's two men less to fight aboard the ship.",
"Yes, finally I can see my 'Santiago' again. I am impatient to be on her deck again. It has been too long.", 
"I can't wait either, the chance for my blade to prove its worth. Do you like swimming, Bartolomeu?",
"No, not really. But for my ship I will make an exception.",
"Let me give a lesson to this braggart, I should have killed him after the warehouse mission, I wanted to after the danger he put me in, the rat!",
"No! Wait! Pedro is mine. I will fight him. I will make him bleed for the things he has done.",
"I understand, Bartolomeu. Take care, he is a cunning and dirty fighter, no honour that scum!",
"Don't worry. He will die soon.",
"Well done, Bartolomeu! Now I see where that Portuguese saying actually came from!",
"That bastard deserved what was coming to him! I never thought I'd ever see the 'Santiago' again! Now, if you want, follow me ashore to meet Pijuan.",
"Well Bartolomeu, now you got the 'Santiago' back what are you going to do? Are you still interested in making an expedition with me?",
"Yes, but not immediately. Seeing that I've got my fast caravel, I need to train my crew and sail the ship for a few months before being ready for an expedition with you.",
"I'm hurt that you want to leave me so soon. Anyway, we'll have other opportunities in the future. In the meantime, take care of the 'Santiago' and be careful otherwise someone will steal your ship again. HA-HA!",
"Don't worry, I'll miss you too. I've learned my lesson and none will be able to take her from me again.",
"Time has come for us to part company. So, see you soon, and behave, Bartolomeu!",
"Thanks a lot for everything, Roxanne. I will always have fond memories of our time together!",
"Here are my friends! Now, we are finally ready for the attack at #sSantiago#.",
"Excellent! Set sail!",
"I learned there are some rumours in #sisland_Isla Muelle# about a statuette in gold.",
"Humm... Can you be clearer?",
"It's an indian idol that venerate an unknown tribe. People tell it even has magical powers.",
"Roxanne, I don't want to be pessimistic but it seems to be a legend, nothing more.",
"I don't agree and I'm not the only one. The Spaniards are looking for it. They believe, thanks to its magical powers, the idol could be used against their enemies, nations and pirates of course.",
"If true, That could spell the end of the piracy in this archipelago.",
"Indeed, so too the end of our activities.",
"Yes. You said that the rumours come from #sisland_Isla Muelle#?",
"The governor of the colony, himself, is directing the search.",
"Do you know if the Spaniards have found any information about its location?",
"Nobody knows. So.. Are you interested in going to #sisland_Isla Muelle# and finding the idol before them?",
"Another dangerous mission... But if the idol really exists and we find it before our dear enemy, that could be our greatest achievement. Let's go, I can't wait anymore... I need to know more about this story.",
"Finally, here we are.",
"Right and I don't like this place. If the authorities recognize us, we will quickly be at the end of a rope.",
"Ha! Ha! Don't worry be happy Bartolomeu!",
"Only when I find the idol, and for that we need a clue. So, I suggest dividing our efforts. While I go to the tavern collecting information, you will do the same on the streets of the town. In this way, we'll have a better chance of finding a lead.",
"Alright, but don't seize the opportunity of drinking too much... I want you sober later, I have some plans for you before morning. Ha ha ",
"Oohh, women.. Now, you know why I want to stay single. Ha! Ha! Let's start working, we'll meet on the Trade Square.",
"Sorry for my lateness. Did you find anything?",
"Yes and no. I confirm the rumour really exists, but I still don't know if it's based on truth. And you?",
"I met an old acquaintance also looking for the idol?",
"Now I'm jealous - A pirate?",
"Don't be, he's just a sailor. But, the most interesting thing is that he works for Francois l'Ollonais.",
"Dash it! is he in the town too?",
"No, in the jungle near here. He sent some of his men to find where the idol is.",
"If this situation goes on. We will meet more pirates in this town than on #sTortuga#.",
"Very true, the Spaniards will quickly suspect that something is happening in their town.",
"I'm not really happy to know l'Ollonais is around. He must know by now that I arrested and handed his friend, Charles Baxter, over to the Portuguese.",
"That would be a problem if he had seen you before. But, he hasn't ever met you, has he?",
"No, he doesn't know me. At worst, he will know my name.",
"Alright, don't worry, Bartolomeu. Anyway, I didn't tell you the entire story.",
"What do you mean?",
"After meeting his crewmember, I met l'Ollonais.",
"Why did you do that? We don't need him. He doesn't have any information about the location of the idol.",
"Even if I don't like the man, I don't agree for two reasons. First, he has a lot of experience and as a partner, he could make our search easier. Secondly, he won't want any rivals in this search and we can't do it with the Spaniards and l'Ollonais both against us.",
"Alright, and what are the terms of the deal? What will happen if we find the idol?",
"Of course, I told him that I had a partner and I wouldn't decide anything before speaking to you.",
"Thanks for your sincerity. Let's meet l'Ollonais and discuss our future agreement.",
"I'll do it.",
"Thanks Roxanne, but I won't let you do it. I don't want a hair on your head touched, I'll go.",
"Ok. Have you got anything in mind?",
"Excellent! Let's wait a bit for my crew and to bring the ship to this shore.",
"That's done. Let's go!",
"Alright!",
"He told the truth. There is only one shore accessible to these lands.",
"Right. Let's be careful during the walk. There are most probably indians in the area.",
"Bastard, Francois I mean!",
"As you say. He thinks he won the 'race' but we can still give him a lesson. Let's go and catch him.",
"Look! François l'Ollonais is dead, someone beat us to it!",
"Oh look at him! What could have done this?! He is crushed. The bones are broken but there is no blood.",
"Listen, do you hear?",
"Someone is coming!",
"OH MY GOD! What is it?! ",
"A giant. I've never seen anyone even half as big!",
"And now, do you believe this idol has magical powers or are you still sceptical?",
"Well, I think you were right. I don't like that.",
"I found the idol in the Francois' clothes. Let's go, I don't want to meet any more giants again.",
"Me, either!",
"The Director General ran away!",
"Yes, he has already boarded his ship. I think he is to engage our ships. Prepare for battle.",
"What are we going to do about the idol?",
"I'll show you what we are going to do.",
"Ahh... What did you do that for?",
"The best thing I could do : Throwing it into the sea. The idol is a cursed object. We don't know what the consequences would be if the wrong person got a hold of it.",
"That's a wise decision, even if we sweated to find the idol, we may have lost a lot of gold, but saved our way of life.",
"Indeed. Now, we have the guarantee that no nation can stop piracy or dominate the archipeligo.",
"And now, what are your plans?",
"At the moment, I am not sure. I am not yet ready to settle down in one place. And you?",
"I need a break and will stay here, a few months at least. Maybe the governor needs a corsair.",
"Alright... I have to go Roxanne, but when I feel the need for you, I'll be back.",
"Thanks Bartolomeu!",
"See you.",
"Bartolomeu!",
"Nice to see you again, Roxanne!",
"How did you know I was here?",
"A too long story to tell you now. We must quickly leave the fort...",
"Alright. I'll prepare my ship for sea.",
"Wait Roxanne! You don’t have to accompany us. Johan and I can do that.",
"Are you joking? You almost got yourself killed releasing me and I want to help you free Emilio?? No way I'm letting you go now, I’m coming with you.",
"As you like, I haven't the time for an argument. Let’s sail, there's not a moment to lose.",
"And now?",
"You wait for me here while I and Elting release Emilio.",
"What?!",
"Yes and this time, it isn't negotiable, I don't want you hurt. Only.... if we aren’t back today, please come and rescue us.",
"You took your sweet time. I was getting worried.",
"We’ve done it as quickly as possible. Now, we have to leave Cuba. Havana must be mobbed by soldiers after what we did there.",
"Any preference where to?",
"Let’s go to #sRedmond#. We’ll decide there what's next, we just have to get to a safe harbour.",
"We are safe now.",
"We didn't have the opportunity to talk earlier, but the Governor of #sFalaise de Fleur# said that you were on a mission in Alice Town?",
"Yes. Fortunately, I'd just finished it when I was kidnapped.",
"So, you intend to return to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#?",
"Yes, why do you ask? ",
"I was thinking we could stay together for a while - maybe make an expedition like we did in Santiago on Cuba.",
"I like the idea. Drop in #sFalaise de Fleur# over the next few months, we'll discuss it again. I have some things to look after first.",
"Alright, Roxanne. Have a safe trip and may the wind be behind you, I'll meet you there when I can.",
"Look who's here! My Captain Bartolomeu... and Captain Montbars. What a surprise!",
"Hello, Roxanne. Nice to see you again. We are here for business.",
"Business? What kind of business?",
"A big expedition to #sisland_Isla Muelle#. Are you interested?",
"Are you joking? I'll sail with you anytime. ",
"No I'm not joking. Much gold can be stolen on this mission.",
"You've aroused my curiosity. Please explain more?",
"Yes, I'm glad your aroused, but not here. There are too many ears in this room. Follow me to the port.",
"Interesting, this story of gold reserves on #sisland_Isla Muelle#.",
"Yes, at the very least. Well, I gave you all the details. Can we count on you?",
"Of course. This mission could be the most lucrative expedition of all in the last few years.",
"I think so. Prepare your ship, we're going to weigh anchor.",
"What a fight! We won!",
"For now. However, most of the soldiers are still inside the fort.",
"Where is the entry?",
"I think I saw a door behind the wall. Let's check!",
"Are you OK, Bartolomeu?",
"Well, at least, I'm not dead.",
"Only by a whisker, we are lucky to be still alive. The explosion was terrific.",
"Yes, terrific. By the way, where is Montbars?",
"I don't know. Like you, I've just come to. But not only has he disappeared, the gold is gone too.",
"WHAT?! How is it possible? Someone must have taken it?",
"We should get out of here. Maybe, Montbars or Fontaines are loading the gold from the beach...",
"You must be right. Let's go!",
"I must leave you again.",
"Do you return to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#?",
"Yes. The Governor still needs my services. But, I'll be always there for you.",
"Thanks, Roxanne, I will remember that. Enjoy your voyage!",
"Congratulations, Bartolomeu. This mercenary was a strong adversary.",
"Indeed, much more dangerous than Pedro Rivera.",
"And now?",
"Let's discreetly leave the fort, there are still some guards outside.",
"The situation is getting dangerous.",
"Yes, too many enemies in a short while. It's a miracle we are still alive.",
"Let's get to Alice Town on the double.", 
"Emilio? He's in the jail of Havana.",
"How do you know that?",
"Elting said it during a talk.",
"Can you help me to free Emilio?",
"Are you joking? You almost got yourself killed in releasing me and I you think I won’t help you free Emilio?? You dummy, of course, I’ll go with you.",
"Thanks, Roxanne. Let’s weigh anchor.",
"We’ll free Emilio tonight. Let's go!",
"Not easy to climb the walls.",
"We can’t enter by the door at this hour. The guards would be suspicious and take more interest in us than we want.",
"Why did you tell me to hide my weapons?",
"In order to get into the prison, you will understand soon. Follow me.",
"Done! I killed the last one.",
"Good. Let's return to our ships.",
"That was a dangerous operation!",
"Indeed. We should leave Cuba, Havana must be swarming with soldiers after what we did there. We didn't have the opportunity to talk earlier, but you were in mission in Alice Town?",
"You're back, Bartolomeu?",
"What are you doing here, Bartolomeu?",
"Good to see you again, Bartolomeu.",
"I was thinking it was time to make both a new expedition. Have you got anything in mind?",
"It's just a short visit. What happening in your life?",
"Everything is alright. I would prefer if you could stay a while though.",
"Good that your Ok. I'm busy at the moment and have to leave. See you soon as I can, Roxanne!",
