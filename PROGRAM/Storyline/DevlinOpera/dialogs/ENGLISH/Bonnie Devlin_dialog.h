"This is all so exciting!",
"Oh! Is it?",
"Oh! ",
" I'm so pleased to meet you at last. Father told me so much about you. My big sister, here at last!",
"I'm pleased to meet you too, Bonnie. But what's this big sister bit? I thought we were twins?",
"We are, we are! But you were born a minute before me! So that makes you my big sister! Ha! Ha!",
"Ah! I see. I'm glad we got that sorted out. That then puts me in charge. Ha! Ha! So we have a treasure to find... Are you up for the adventure?",
"Oh! Yes. I've been waiting for days for you to get here. When do we leave and where are we going?",
"Well... it says on the map here we should sail to #sisland_Turks# Island and look for the pirate Short Jack Gold, and ask him if he knows anything about the dirty snow! That seems a bit odd.",
"It's code, it's code! It's got to be in code. It will work out when we get there you'll see.",
"I hope you're right, or we are going to look really stupid, going up to a pirate and asking him if about snow!",
"Don't worry so much, ",
"! It will all work out, it always does. When do we sail?",
"As soon as I've checked the stores and equipment we can be off. Once we are out of sight of land, we must remember to raise the pirate flag to be able to land at #sisland_Turks# Island.",
"See, See! I said it was code. Oh! This is getting more exciting by the minute! And we'll get to see Blaze!",
"Calm down, calm down! We haven't found him yet. [THINKS:] Little sisters!",
"Here we are - #sisland_Turks# Island! Boy, how exciting is that! I bet we can meet some real pirates here.",
"Yes, that's why we need to take care, Bonnie. I sent a crewmember ahead to find out where that Short Jack Gold is.",
"While we're waiting for him - Tell me how you ended up in the new world, Beatrice!",
"Well, that's quite a complicated story, Bonnie. But I will tell it. It started about a year ago, I was standing at the Bristol dock, when suddenly...",
"Oh Boy, that must be the pirate haven Short Jack Gold told us about. At least there's no snow...",
"We'll ask around if anyone has seen Blaze, but carefully.",
"Do you think that it's Blaze's ship, Beatrice?",
"It looks like a smuggler's boat... Let's row over and examine it.",
"It is a smuggler's boat! There's the cargo piled up: Barrels of rum! But seems like some of them have been opened... And not a soul on deck!",
"I have a feeling where this is going to lead. Follow me below deck, Bonnie! I think you might just meet our brother.",
"Hello Blaze, It's true! I'm your sister Bonnie! I'm happy to meet you, sorry you're not feeling well today!...",
"Don't encourage him, Bonnie...",
"...Beatrice and I were looking for you because of the treasure! We have one part of the map and like you to join our search!",
"...",
"That ran silky smooth! Our cargo hold is empty and our wallet full!",
"Exactly, and this means we can focus on what's really important: The treasure map! Blaze, hand over your piece of the map so we can put them together and see where the map leads us!",
"Don't worry, Beatrice! We're going to find that ship officer and get the map back!",
"Is your optimism for sale, Bonnie? And you, Blaze, you really made your own brain walk the plank, what?",
"Oh Boy, this town is... Big!",
"I know, right? A voyage through this whole place would take a century!",
"Remember the last time we were waiting for a crewman? You were about to tell me how you ended up in the Caribbean!",
"Right, I didn't get to finish the story. As I said, I was standing at the dock in Bristol, minding my own business, and then out of the blue... Nevermind, I think here comes our crewman!",
"We've got the map! We've got the map!",
"Yes we do, Bonnie, and it is a reason to celebrate. But not a reason to scream so loud it awakens half the town!",
"Oh, let's put the two map pieces together and see where we can find Father's treasure!",
"That's my way of celebrating as well! Let's see, I have some glue right here...",
"What does it say? Is there a big, red 'X', that marks where we find the treasure?",
"Well actually... There's several big, red 'X's, all on different islands! I see one on #sisland_Hispaniola#, this one here is on a small island apparently called #sisland_Cayman#... Ah, and the third one is close to the mainland, on an island named #sisland_Aruba#. And all of them have a name next to them!",
"What?! Three 'X's? What does this mean? Is only one of them the site of the treasure? What's up with the names?",
"I don't know, but we'll only find out if we go there! And maybe look for the persons named on the map... The nearest one is on #sisland_Hispaniola#, near the town of #sSanto Domingo# as it looks. Let's start our search there!",
"Another day, another adventure, another big town in the Kingdom of New Spain!",
"Yes, the first European settlement in the new world, as they say. Finding a man named Marcel Jauri in this place could be difficult. Strange name by the way. And weirdly familiar. Let's just hope he's well known around here.",
"Where do we start?",
"In the tavern of course! And no, Blaze, we won't stop for a drink!", //49
"Good luck, Beatrice! We will wait here for you!",
"Thanks, Bonnie. I'll be back before you know it!", //51
"Hi Beatrice, how do you like the new look? I went shopping with Lorena, and we found this thing called 'hair dye'...",
"Very nice, Bonnie. But please don't just wander off like that!",
"I'm sorry, but you were in there for ages and it got boring! Hey! How did it go? Did you find out anything new about the treasure?",
"Hold on - I don't want to explain everything twice. So where is that rum stain on our family tree?",
"In the tavern!",
"Where else?", // 57
"Another map with even MORE markers? Five of them? It doesn't make sense to me!",
"I must admit, it seems like a tricky game that is played here...",
"I wish I was with you both back then! I only heard stories from Uncle Manny. About you, about our father. But what are we supposed to do with all this maps now? What's the plan?",
"'To find the place you search ASAP'... This doesn't help much. I think our best lead is still going after the names on our combined treasure map. We found Marcel Jauri, so why shouldn't we find the other two as well? Perhaps they can bring some clarity to this whole affair.",
"That sounds like a plan to me as well! Let's do it and see what kind of adventure awaits this time!",
"I think so too. Let's pay this one here a visit: The map shows the name Killian O'Byrne on #sisland_Cayman#. This will be our next stop. The marker is not very precise on a map of this scale, I think we should find a map of the whole island first and compare it to the one with the names.",
"Eeeeh, snakes! Do we really have to poke around in the jungle? Can't this man come to us somehow?",
"I must admit, it doesn't sound particularly inviting. Perhaps this hermit is a bit... strange, after living alone in the woods for so long.",
