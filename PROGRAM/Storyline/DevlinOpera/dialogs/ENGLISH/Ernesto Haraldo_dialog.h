"Wait - May I know who you are and what you do in my bedroom, Señorita?",
"Wait - May I you know what YOU are doing here? Aren't you the groom?",
"Well, yes...",
"Then why are you in here, all alone? Why are you not with your guests?",
"This... I don't... Why don't you ask me? It is not...",
"Come on, you can tell me.",
"It is... You're beautiful.",
"Thank you! But you're changing the subject...",
"Please. Let's just forget about it. Have a glass of wine with me while you're here, alright?",
"Look Señor, I don't really know you. Heck, I don't even really know how I've ended up here. But perhaps I can help you. Why don't you just give it a try?",
"A glass of wine? Well, I can't say no to that!",
"...and so I arrested them both at the spot and said 'You messed with the wrong Spaniard, perros sarnosos!'",
"Sounds exciting! Can I get a refill?",
"There you go, dearest. Now tell me about you. Tell me about the ships you've sailed on, the islands you've explored, the battles you've fought... The men you've loved.",
"Ooooh! Are you jealous, young Spaniard?",
"No! Not at all! Jealousy isn't something a proud Spanish warrior ever allows! Perhaps a little jealous... But only of the men.",
"Hi-hi... If I'm blushing now I blame the wine!",
"You're a convincing little one, aren't one? Well then, to be honest: I don't like this wedding. I don't like how fast everything happened with me and Isabel. I don't like how my father takes pride in this as if I was his circus horse. And I don't like most of my guests. Kofi Macchiato is the worst.",
"Have you tried talking to your father about this? Or your wife?",
"Well... No. It didn't seem like I had much of a saying in all of this. And I was afraid to displease Isabel. She seems so happy with everything.",
"If I may give you an advice: Drop the pretences. This should be about your happiness first and foremost. If you feel uncomfortable about anything, talk to your father. And talk to Isabel! Your father shouldn't dictate your actions, but she's involved in this marriage too.",
"Maybe you're right...",
"And even if you feel like you don't like her enough - Speak out! It may hurt at first, but it would be the right and honest thing to do.",
"Oh, I do like her! It's just... The circumstances feel a little bit wrong at the moment. It almost feels as if I need to get to know her better first.",
"And I'm sure she will respect that!",
"Thank you, lass. You have spoken wisely. I feel much better now!",
"Then I won't bother you anymore. Think about what I told you! I wish you all the best.",
