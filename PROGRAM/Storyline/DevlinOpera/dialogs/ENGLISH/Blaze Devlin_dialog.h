"So what's the next step? It's taking a break, if y'ask me, sister.",
"All in good time, dear brother.",
"*LOUD SNORE*",
"He! Blaze! Get up, you lazy scapegrace!",
"What.. Who is it? Not so loud! But... Beatrice? Is that you?",
"OF COURSE IT IS ME YOU USELESS RUM BARREL OF A BROTHER! GET UP!",
"For God's sake, Bea, stop yelling! I have a terrible headache... I'm seeing double!",
"You're not seeing double, you lousy drunk, you're seeing my twin sister!",
"Twin sister? But... How? Where? What?",
"Yes, I didn't know about her either until two weeks ago.",
"Ooh... My head is swimming. Well, at least one sister that treats me nicely! What's that you're saying about a treasure map?",
"Forget the treasure map for a moment, you stole rum from those pirates on... Snow-island!",
"Snow-island? Ah, you mean Nevis.",
"Nevis?",
"Yes, nobody can remember that Spanish tongue-twister except for the Spanish. I call it 'Nevis' and I believe that'll stick.",
"Whatever. They're furious. Why didn't you deliver the shipment?",
"Sweet, sweet coins, little Bea! Found a better buyer! Some officer on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# ordered rum for his son's wedding. Pays a good price.",
"Don't call me Bea! And how do you intend to deliver the rum if you drank half of it yourself during the voyage?",
"Just a sip to wet the whistle!",
"Sure... Alright, we deliver the remaining rum to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# so you can keep at least some of your dignity as a 'Merchant'. But we leave that nutshell you call a boat behind, it's about to sink anyway. You come aboard with us and we'll load the rum!",
"Here we are, the Spanish estate on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#! We're gonna sell the rum to one of the garrison commanders. Oh, I can already here those sweet coins jingle!",
"Only one of us needs to go see that officer, the rest of the party can stay behind.",
"Sure, why not. Who do you think should go, little Bea?",
"I'll do it myself. The two of you would just cause more trouble!",
"You got us into this pickle, Blaze, you deal with this yourself!",
"Bonnie should go, so you and me can catch up with one another.",
