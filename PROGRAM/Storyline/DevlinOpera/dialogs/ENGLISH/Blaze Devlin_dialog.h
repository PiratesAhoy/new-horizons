"So what's the next step? It's taking a break, if y'ask me, sister.",
"All in good time, dear brother.",
"*LOUD SNORE*",
"He! Blaze! Get up, you lazy scapegrace!",
"What.. Who is it? Not so loud! But... Beatrice? Is that you?",
"OF COURSE IT IS ME YOU USELESS RUM BARREL OF A BROTHER! GET UP!",
"For God's sake, Bea, stop yelling! I have a terrible headache... I'm seeing double!",
"You're not seeing double, you lousy drunk, you're seeing my twin sister!",
"Twin sister? But... How? Where? What?",
"Yes, I didn't know about her either until two weeks ago.",
"Ooh... My head is swimming. Well, at least one sister that treats me nicely! What's that you're saying about a treasure map?",
"Forget the treasure map for a moment, you stole rum from those pirates on... Snow-island!",
"Snow-island? Ah, you mean Nevis.",
"Nevis?",
"Yes, nobody can remember that Spanish tongue-twister except for the Spanish. I call it 'Nevis' and I believe that'll stick.",
"Whatever. They're furious. Why didn't you deliver the shipment?",
"Sweet, sweet coins, little Bea! Found a better buyer! Some officer on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# ordered rum for his son's wedding. Pays a good price.",
"Don't call me Bea! And how do you intend to deliver the rum if you drank half of it yourself during the voyage?",
"Just a sip to wet the whistle!",
"Sure... Alright, we deliver the remaining rum to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# so you can keep at least some of your dignity as a 'Merchant'. But we leave that nutshell you call a boat behind, it's about to sink anyway. You come aboard with us and we'll load the rum!",
"Here we are, the Spanish estate on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#! We're gonna sell the rum to one of the garrison commanders. Oh, I can already here those sweet coins jingle!",
"Only one of us needs to go see that officer, the rest of the party can stay behind.",
"Sure, why not. Who do you think should go, little Bea?",
"I'll do it myself. The two of you would just cause more trouble!",
"You got us into this pickle, Blaze, you deal with this yourself!",
"Bonnie should go, so you and me can catch up with one another.", //25
"...",
"Blaze?",
"Ehm...",
"I don't believe it! Don't tell me you lost your piece of the map!",
"Well... Not 'lost' as in 'I can't find it', rather 'lost' as in 'I played a little game of cards'...!",
"A GAME OF CARDS? I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, YOU USELESS, SLOSHED, LAZY GAMBLER!",
"This ship officer wanted to raise the stakes, and this paper was the only thing I could offer him. A messenger had given it to me earlier, I didn't think it was important...",
"Not important?! This treasure map is our family's heritage! What are we supposed to do with only half a map? Light a cozy fire?!", //33
"Look, I'm sorry, Bea. I didn't think about that, not after having a cup of rum. Or two.",
"Don't call me that! Do you at least remember when and where you LOST the map?",
"It must have been not too long before I met you... And it certainly was in the tavern of #sGreenford# on #sisland_Oxbay#. It was the navigator of a Spanish treasure ship who won the map piece from me.",
"Now... Can you please remember the name of this ship so we might at least have the shadow of a lead?",
"Sure, the ship's name was...",
"'Villa de Malaga' was its name! Now I remember it.",
"Well then. There is nothing else left for us to do than going to #sGreenford# and asking about the 'Villa de Malaga'. It's the only lead we have... Perhaps it's not too late to find that ship and her bloody navigator. Let's sail!",
"Will you look at that, you're not a bad navigator after all! We've reached #sisland_Cuba#. Or 'Cuba' as it is also called. The crown jewel of the Spaniards!",
"Sounds like you've been here before, Blaze.",
"Well, I have. But the Spaniards can't take a joke when it comes to smuggling... I've spent a few days and nights in the arrest cells of their local guard houses.",
"I can imagine that... But the way you put it they must be watching after this island as if it was the eyeball of King Philipp II.",
"They certainly do. After all it's their main base of operations in the new world, the place where the treasure fleet assembles to go back to Europe and the place where the explorers start for their conquests of the mainland. And wherever you go, Diego Velazquez de Cuellar, the man who first claimed and settled the island for Spain about 50 years ago, is a national hero.",
"But he didn't have much competition in his exploits, did he?",
"Not from Europe at that time. But you're forgetting the people that lived here before, the Taíno tribes. Their chieftain, a fellow going by the name of Hatuey, fought the Spanish intruders as well as he could, but was defeated and executed. If y'ask me, he's the true hero of the story, taking on the Spaniards with sticks and stones or whatever!",
"Sounds like a brave man.",
"Ha! He surely was. When he was about to be executed, he was asked one more time if he wants to go to heaven. Hatuey asked, if the Spaniards go to heaven, the Spanish priest said yes. So Hatuey answered he would rather go to hell, to get away from the Spaniards! That's my kind of guy...",
"Ha-ha, yes, I could see you getting along with him!",
"Anyway, since then, #sisland_Cuba# has grown into the Spanish powerhouse it is today. Especially after the French corsairs attacked, burnt and plundered both #sSantiago# and #sHavana# in a row some twenty years ago. The Spanish rebuilt their fortresses, doubled their troops and have been very vigilant and very humourless ever since.",
"You mean, it's best if we try to get along with the locals when we anchor at #sSantiago#.",
"Exactly. And we don't want to try to make any overland detours. If the 'Villa de Malaga' is in port, it's best to not lose any time and go there as quickly as possible.",
"I see... And Blaze?",
"Yeah?",
"You're quite the historian, ha-ha!",
"Maybe I am. But to you, I'll always be the same old drunk, rotten scoundrel, little Bea!",
"Don't call me...!",  //58
"But the 'Villa de Malaga' is in port at the very least. Now we only need to find her navigator and take the map back!",
"I instructed a crewmember to snoop around a little bit. Where is he anyway? He should be back by now.",
"Let's get to the tavern then and find that bastard!",
"Wait a minute, Blaze. All three of us confronting him would raise suspicion, if not even get us into trouble. I think two of us should stay here.",
"Hmm, if you think so. Should we draw straws?",
"I do it myself!",
"It's your fault we are even here, Blaze! You go.",
"Bonnie probably has a trick up her sleeve to make him hand over the map.", // 66
"Cheers to that!",
"Blaze, put the rum away this instant! That's not what I meant when I said 'celebrate'.",
"Take it easy, Captain Spoilsport, we... Hey! That bottle is mine!",
"You get it back later!", //70
"Little Bea, sit down, join the game! But I'm warning you, I'm on a lucky streak right now. Ha Ha!",
"Don't call me that! What do you think you're doing, gambling away our ship money?!",
"Sister -  Why do you always assume the worst of me? I just told you: I'm on a lucky streak!",
"Oh yes?",
"See? Not such a bad guy after all!",
"Oh. How much did you win?",
"20'000 Spanish gold coins! That should be enough to resupply the ship before our next voyage. But to be fair, when it comes to cards these two don't know the difference between the front and the back. Ha Ha!",
"Very well. You win this time, Blaze. But lose the idiots, we have things to discuss. I'll invite you and our dressed to kill baby sister for a drink.", // 78
"'Captain E'... Do you think that was our father himself?",
"It looks that way to me. It's a strange story, and it shows how little we actually know of him and of what happened after he went away.",
"But I remember when he left. We were kids, standing at the dock, waving at our father aboard a ship which he boarded with promises of money for our poor family. Then he was swallowed by the sea fog and we never heard from him again.",
"I remember that as well. It's part of the reason I went to Lisbon and joined this expedition in the first place. To find out what happened to him in the new world. Little did I know I would soon be up to my neck in riddles and vague treasure maps!",
"Well, it's part of the reason I came here as well...",
"Blaze! You surprise me! I always thought you went to sea for easy money and fast women!", // 84
"Girls! Typical! This is obviously man's business. Why don't you two enjoy some girl time with coffee and pie while I go into the jungle and find the hermit. No problem for me!",
"Oh, I see, you're very brave and very helpful, Blaze. Alright, since you know it all and can do it all, we leave everything to you. We're so relieved to know ourselves savely in your manly hands. Come on, Bonnie.",
