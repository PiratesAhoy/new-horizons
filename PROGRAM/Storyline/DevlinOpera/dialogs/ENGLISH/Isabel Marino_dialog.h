"What are you planning to do with that rug beater, Madam? Madam...?! [THINKS:] She's hysterical! I have to get out of here! Quick, the window behind me!",
"Are you awake? How are you feeling? Don't move! Here, have a glass of water.",
"Oooh, my head... Where am I? What happened?",
"You're safely in town! Someone gave you a very bad beating at one of those stupid fights my stupid father-in-law arranges. You've been unconscious all night. What a terrible thing! I'll have a word with him, or with my dear husband at least.",

"Thanks, lass. I'm going to look for some water then, or even better, rum. Shame you're taken by the way.",
