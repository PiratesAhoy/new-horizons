"Actually, I simply walked through the front door. My name is Blaze Devlin.", // 3
"Ah, ah, ah. And what is your request?",
"A french pirate ship has been sighted, circling around the island.",
"I see. Your report is hereby duly noted and appreciated. Enjoy your further stay at #sGrand Cayman#. Good day.",
"That's all? What are you going to do about the threat?",
"This is not exactly a threat, young man. From our experience, pirates don't show much interest in the colony of #sGrand Cayman# or its shipping. They probably just make a stop at the other side of the island, to refill their water supplies. The people of our settlement are not endangered by that.",
"But they are most likely going to plunder richer spanish ships in the region!",
"That, on the other hand may be, and that is why I will send an emergency messenger to both #sRedmond# and #sHavana# to stay particularly vigilant. But the security of our colony is not threatened.",
"What about Killian O'Byrne? He and his daughter live in the wilderness of #sisland_Cayman#. They may be threatened by the pirates.",
"Young man, this here is a spanish colony, which I am responsible for. Neither are this... O'Byrne and his bastard daughter spanish citizens, nor do they live in the colony. Which means that their security is their own business. They refuse my protection by living on their own, and there's nothing more I can do about it.",
"Funny, from what I heard, you and your people expelled them from the colony. Seems like you have a lax relationship with the truth, don't you?",
"Young man, my patience is running out! I am not - I repeat - NOT responsible for savages who live in the shrubs with the ants and wild monkeys! And that's all I have to say about the matter.",
"Funny again, because so far, the only monkey I've seen on #sisland_Cayman# is wearing a wig and screaming around in the town hall.",
"How dare you insult me like that! Leave my study at once!",
"Goodbye.", // 17
"Out, out! I shall call the guards! Out!",
"You sound like a barking dog.",
