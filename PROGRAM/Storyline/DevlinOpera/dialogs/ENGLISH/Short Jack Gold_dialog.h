"Welcome to our island. Pray tell me your name.",
"My name is ",
"And to what do we owe the pleasure of your company on this fine day?",
"I am looking for Captain Short Jack Gold, Sir. Can you help me find him?",
"Is that so? And why would you be looking for him? You don't know him do you?",
"No Sir, I don't, but I have a letter from my father which says Captain Gold would be able to help me in a matter of some importance.",
"I see.. And who is your father?",
"My father has passed away. He name was Eugene Devlin.",
"Ah! Eugene Devlin.. Yes I know him, or rather knew him. Well, Captain that changes things. I am the Short Jack Gold you are seeking, how might I be of assistance?",
"Captain Gold, this is going to sound awfully silly, but my father's letter tells me to ask you if you would show me some dirty snow. Here you may read it.",
"Ha! Ha! Ha! It does it indeed! That old fox Eugene, as crafty as ever! But true to his word.",
"Sir! That is my father you speak of, and I would ask you to show more respect.",
"Calm down. I mean no disrespect to your father. In fact I honor his skill in imparting such an important message in such a simple way.",
"Important message? What do you mean?",
"Many years ago, your father found a vast treasure... It appears, that he sent you the location, hidden in this map.",
"But the map is torn! Where is the other part?",
"Your father must have sent a second message with the rest of the information in that, so if one message were intercepted, it wouldn't help without the other. Now, who could your father have sent letters to? Obviously within the family, he wouldn't have trusted anyone else.",
"Well, me, my sister Bonnie... and... My brother Blaze...",
"So there you have it. Your sister has received nothing, else she would have told you, so it is your brother Blaze you need to find to complete the puzzle. And this note here tells you where you have to look for him.",
"How so?",
"The snow! There is a small island in the lesser antilles, which the Spaniards call #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#. Meaning 'Our Lady of the Snow'. And its 'dirty' side is on the west coast, which is a notorious hideout for smugglers and pirates...",
"When I knew how simple it was... I guess I have a lot to learn! Thank you, Captain Gold!",
"Nothing to thank, Miss Devlin. No go search for your brother, and good fortune to you.",
"Oh I will, Captain Gold!",
