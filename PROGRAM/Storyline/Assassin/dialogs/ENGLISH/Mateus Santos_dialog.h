"Captain, so long as your assignment remains alive, we have nothing whatsoever to discuss. Remember that I value promptness and the sands of time are running out.",
"Order flowers for his widow, Santos, the bell is tolling and the bawdy hand of the dial is on the prick of High Noon.",
"Here is the 3000 gold we agreed upon Captain, and I've been given to understand that Bricenos' body lies upon #sisland_Hispaniola#' shore.",
"Yes, I could say that he's all washed up.",
"Thank you, but this experience has convinced me that the tide is running out on our association,... and I'm sailing on it.",
"Ah, captain! Well done - you've certainly earned your 4500 gold. I trust everything went smoothly?",
"Yes, ",
"Geffrey Bampfylde",
"'s accounts are settled. I'd be interested in making the balance in my own account a little healthier. Do you have another assignment?",
"Settling that account has left me feeling out of balance, I've no taste for this, and if it's all the same to you, I'm going to go back on the account. Farewell.",
"Captain, you never cease to amaze me! To be honest, I wasn't certain you could handle ",
"Pepin Bertillon",
". Please accept my apologies for doubting you. Along with your 7000 gold, as agreed.",
"What can I say? He tried to smuggle my blade in his ribcage and got caught with his contraband.",
"Sadly, this experience has convinced me that I can't smuggle this kind of work past my conscience any longer. Our association has ended.",
"Captain, truly you exceed all expectation. Here is your 10000 gold, and tell me how you managed to defeat ",
"Amerigo Vieira",
"? He eluded my best men for several years!",
"I'd prefer not discussing this particular assignment with you, Santos.",
"Never mind how I did it. It's done. And I've had enough of this kind of work.",
"Captain, you've done me a great favor by ridding me of the Italian! Unfortunately, you've also learned too much. You'll have to take this knowledge to an early grave. I'm very sorry, captain.",
"So, ",
"Vito Leone",
" was right about your treachery! I should've taken him at his word. Please express my apologies to him when you see him in Hell!",
"Captain, what are you doing here?!",
"I've discovered that you can learn a lot from old sayings; don't shoot the messenger comes to mind, as Don ",
"Vito Leone",
" has told me a lot of interesting things about the way you do business. In particular, he told me that your partners have a tendency to die young...",
"Ah, my dear Captain ",
"! My partner Vassal said you're a former Dutch soldier, aren't you?",
"Indeed. But first, can I know who are you?",
"You're right. I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Mateus Santos, a former mercenary and now director of a particular society.",
"What do you mean with 'particular society'?",
"Let's say, there are people willing to pay much to get rid of their enemies.",
"That sounds good.",
"I think so. So, are you interested in working for me? I could propose a truly profitable job...",
"Of course.",
"Ambroz Bricenos",
" has set you up, Captain, pray let your discretion guide your unquestioned valor in your next response. My time is precious and you have already wasted ten minutes of it.",
"Then to put it discreetly, I'll bid you good day with an apology for any disturbance I've caused. I trust I won't have to fight my way out?",
" (Takes out a watch) Actually I've wasted fifteen minutes of your time and you haven't any left. Shall we dance?!",
"You won't have to, captain, I take no offense - one gets used to this sort of thing in my line of work. In fact, if you're interested, I could propose a truly profitable job...",
"What can I say? Consider me a captive audience.",
"Thanks for the offer, but this encounter has turned my interest away from this sort of work.",
"The conditions are very simple. First: You have three months to finish the job - no more. If the job is done on time, the reward will be waiting for you as long as it takes you to come and collect.",
"...",
"Second: You never leave a witness. No exceptions will be tolerated.",
"...",
"And third: Upon receiving your reward, you accept a new assignment immediately. You may refuse it, but I'll allow for no vacillation.",
"...",
"Those are the conditions. If you violate just one of them - or refuse to take a job - we will no longer be working together. In fact, it would be unwise to speak with me again.",
"I can work within those conditions. What would my first job be?",
"I see. Thanks for the offer, but I'm not an assassin.",
"A merchant called Ambroz Bricenos knew I had to kill him and he decided to hire a common assassin to kill me before. No need to say, at the moment, his assassin is rotting somewhere in the jungle. So, eliminate him. That will prove your loyalty to me and earn you 3000 gold.",
"Where can I find him?",
"On #sisland_Hispaniola#. He works with many smugglers so you should meet him at Boca de Yuman.",
"Ambroz Bricenos",
". That will prove your loyalty to me and earn you 3000 gold.",
"Regard it as a mere formality. I'll be back soon.",
"Hmmm, as tempting as your offer is, I must decline it.",
"Perfect. Don't forget, you've got exactly three months to do it.",
"I remember.",
"Then I won't delay you further, captain.",
"Ambroz Bricenos",
", well - don't bother. He won't be found,...alive.",
"Understood. Goodbye.",
"Too bad - it was such a pleasure working with you. Farewell, my dear captain.",
"Goodbye.",
"You shouldn't have said that, captain. I simply cannot tolerate rudeness. Prepare to die, my friend!",
"To be your friend I'd have to be stupid!",
"My congratulations. Now, your next target is a merchant banker by the name of ",
"Geffrey Bampfylde",
"Geffrey Bampfylde",
". His house is in #sGreenford#, across the street and just to the left of the tavern. The fee for this assignment is 4500 gold.",
"A banker, eh? Time for a foreclosure and a withdrawal.",
"I've already lost interest, killing a banker bankrupts it. Farewell.",
"I'm uncertain as to which aspect of your personality I appreciate more, your ruthless efficiency or your morbid wit. Attend to me, for you'll need all your wit for this next assignment.",
"Sounds intriguing, tell me about it.",
"Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. I'm out of the game.",
"The target is a smuggler named ",
"Pepin Bertillon",
"Pepin Bertillon",
". He has been quite hard to track down - we've only managed to learn that his ship often visits #sisland_Turks#.",
"The pirate island, eh? Convenient - no soldiers to deal with....",
"Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. I'm out of the game.",
"No soldiers, true. But there are cutthroats, and lots of them. They're stupid, but armed and dangerous. So ",
"Pepin Bertillon",
" is not likely to show up there without bodyguards. Considering the danger, the reward for this job is 7000 gold.",
"For that kind of money, you can consider it done.",
"Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. I'm out of the game.",
"Considering the extent of your abilities, I'm sure you're downplaying your accomplishment, however, the next job is going to be quite difficult, even for you.",
"I can handle it.",
"In that case, I'll pass.",
"I hope you can, because this time the target is my most personal enemy. His name is ",
"Amerigo Vieira",
"Amerigo Vieira",
". He lives on #sisland_Conceicao#, in a house to the right of the governor's residence, upstairs.",
"And how much is this dangerous job worth to you?",
"Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. I'm out of the game.",
"10000 gold. But remember: He's the best swordsman in the archipelago. I'm counting on you, captain. ",
"Amerigo Vieira",
" has betrayed me, and I can't rest easy while he's alive.",
"If he's any kind of swordsman I'll soon have him sorted out.",
"Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. I'm out of the game.",
"I'm not certain that I appreciate your tone, in spite of your enviable skills, however, I have a new assignment that I feel only you would be capable of accomplishing.",
"Somehow I had a feeling that you were going to say something along those lines.",
"I've had enough of your jobs. Henceforward, do them yourself.",
"Not long ago, a messenger from the mainland arrived in the archipelago. He must die, and as soon as possible. The news he brings is too dangerous.",
"Perhaps the old adage about how no news is good news rings true. What are you willing to pay to find out?",
"I've had enough of your jobs. I'm out of this racket.",
"Truly a royal sum - 20000 gold. This job is very important to me.",
"It has suddenly become very important to me as well. How do I find this person?",
"I have grown tired of hearing your voice. I quit!",
"That could be a problem. We don't know his exact location, or even his name. We know only that he's an old Italian, and that he's somewhere on #sisland_Guadeloupe#. So you'll have to go there and find him yourself.",
"That's not much to go on, but how many places are there on #sisland_Guadeloupe# to hide in?",
"Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. I'm out of this game.",
"I should've known you'd have a little chat with Leone instead of simply killing him! I should have done the job myself. Well, he'll get what's coming to him soon enough. And you'll get yours right now!",
"You're delusional, but I'll be happy to get you back onto the straight and narrow.",
