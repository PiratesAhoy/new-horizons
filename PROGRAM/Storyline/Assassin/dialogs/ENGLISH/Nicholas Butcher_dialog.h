"Hello Captain. I heard you are looking for Roche Brasiliano.",
"That's right. The Vice-Admiral said you may be able to help me in this task.",
"I'll do my best. It's really hard to find him. However, recently, I heard that a former officer of Roche left him after a disagreement. He bought a plantation near #sPointe a Pitre# thanks to the gold earned during his life of pirate.",
"At last some good information. That man should know where Roche has his base.",
"Maybe.. Anyway, it's the only lead I have about Roche.",
"Well, it's always better than nothing.",
"Indeed, let's go to #sCharlestown#.",
"What do you think?",
"She lies like she breathes.",
"Maybe, she is still seeing him.",
"I think so. She must have a house somewhere in this town. We will need to get information from her the hard way, you could find and break into her house, inside she may have letters or a lead about her relationship with Roche.",
"I found her house but the door is locked. What are we going to do?",
"She must have a key of course. We need to steal it but in the brothel, that would be dangerous. They will sound the alarm if we are spotted.",
"So?",
"She should come in a few seconds.",
"Wait for me in front of her house while I steal the key.",
"What did you find?",
"Your next destination, Captain Butcher. This is a letter from Roche explaining he will stay on #sisland_Curacao# for a while.",
"Is there a date in this letter?",
"Yes, I checked. The letter was written three weeks ago.",
"You couldn't find better information than this one. I bet the envoy must also be there.",
"That's a possibility. Let's go to #sisland_Curacao# immediately.",
"Look to your right.",
"Did you note the guards?",
"It seems to be the only house guarded in the village.",
"Maybe it's the house of Roche Brasiliano..",
"We should confirm this talking to the people of the tavern.",
"What do you think Captain?",
"Roche is not here and two men are guarding his house day and night. In my opinion, there is something valuable inside.",
"Or someone I would say...",
"Yes, like a Spanish envoy for instance. Tonight, we'll prepare an operation.",
"The two idiots didn't go away from the door.",
"It's unnecessary to wait anymore, the street is deserted. We need to eliminate these men and quickly check the house.",
"More men of Roche are coming from the tavern! What are we going to do!",
"Leave the village now with the envoy and return to #sHavana#. In the meantime, I'll fight them.",
"You're mad, Captain!",
"No time for discussion. Do what I say and inform the Vice-Admiral that I'll look for Roche.",
"Captain Elting! Good to see you.",
"Thanks, Captain Butcher. I came here because Vice-Admiral Benavides told you are looking for any information about Bartolomeu o Portugues. Is it true?",
"Yes. And, I recently found something.",
"What is it exactly?",
"I learned Bartolomeu captured Charles Baxter, an English Pirate, last year.",
"How this information can help us to find Bartolomeu?",
"The last stay known of Charles Baxter was in #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#. There is a pirate settlement on that island and I bet we could meet some of his friends there.",
"Interesting. We could learn why Bartolomeu arrested Charles Baxter and where he took him. I think we've got a good lead. Let’s go to #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#!",
"I think we'll find in #sConceicao# another leads about Bartolomeu.",
"Right. Let's go to #sisland_Conceicao#.",
"I saw this ship in the port when we landed.",
"Me too. Follow me, I have a plan.",
"What's your plan, Captain?",
"It would be too dangerous to capture Bartolomeu during the day in #sConceicao#. We'll wait for the night so that I take advantage of the darkness to board his ship by surprise.",
"What will I do?",
"Stay near the fort and point your cannons at the fort ones. If my boarding is detected by the soldiers, I want some protection for escaping.",
"Afterwards?",
"Well, as soon as I capture Bartolomeu, we leave this island and go to Havana of course.",
"Let's hope everything will be alright.",
"I hope so. I don't want to be sunk in the port.",
"Do you want I take him to the jail?",
"Yes, Captain Butcher. Do this while I see Vice-Admiral Benavides.",
"Done! He's in the jail, Captain.",
"Thank you. Follow me, Captain Butcher. We must go to Eleuthera to arrest a friend of Bartolomeu called Roxanne Lalliere.",
"Lalliere? I know her but not she's a friend of Bartolomeu.",
"Information given by the Vice-Admiral himself. Let's go first to Puerto la Cruz in order to ask the Governor for help.", 
"Can we go to Alice?",
"Yes, we waited enough. The English officer must be informed by the messenger, now.",
"The town is 'clean'. The officer took the guards outside.",
"Good. She is to leave the tavern at any time.",
"That's her!",
"Let's go!",
"Hot fight.",
"Yeah. She's pretty nervous, she drew her blade before I say she was my prisoner. Let's take her to Puerto la Cruz before the soldiers come back.",
"Do we return to Puerto la Cruz?",
"Yes, but you'll directly go to Havana.",
"Why?",
"Vice-Admiral Benavides said he'll send Captain Padilla to Eleuthera when arriving from Santo Domingo. However, Captain Padilla can be late in his mission. I prefer you go there and inform the Vice-Admiral we have Roxanne Lalliere and we need a galleon now, even if he must send the Havana governor's galleon.",
