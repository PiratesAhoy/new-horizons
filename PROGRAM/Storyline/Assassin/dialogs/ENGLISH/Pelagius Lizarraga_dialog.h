"Who are you?",
"Are you Pelagius?",
"Humm... I don't understand what you ask.",
"And if I talk about the Vice-Admiral, do you understand better now?",
"You work for Benavides?",
"Right. I came to take you back to #sHavana#. But maybe, you want to rot in this sewer with the thieves.",
"Never! They kidnapped me to sell me as slave in another island.",
"Now you are under my protection, follow me!",
"Captain Elting!",
"Nice to see you again.",
"You must be here due to the cannons of #sisland_Isla Mona#.",
"Yes. The Vice-Admiral seems to be worried by them.",
"Not only him but all the Spanish authorities.",
"I need to be hired by the Admiral of Antigua. Have you got some hints before I meet him?",
"He doesn't like to hire privateers, and he won't hire you at all unless you have a Letter of Marque from England. So, if you don't already have such a Letter, get one as soon as possible. Then you should insist if he refuses you at the beginning.",
"Alright. Do you think I'll quickly have a mission for #sisland_Isla Mona#?",
"Only an escort mission I think. The English garrison of #sisland_Isla Mona# must get fresh supplies each six months. Therefore, the Admiral sends a merchant ship with an escort.",
"When did he send the last merchant ship?",
"Four months ago.",
"So, I need to work for him for the next two months at least.",
"Don't worry. When he prepares a new mission for #sisland_Isla Mona# I'll tell you so that you can suggest your help.",
"Thanks. Well, I need to talk to him. See you soon.",
"Captain! Wait a minute.",
"What happens, Pelagius?",
"The Portadmiral is just about to send a ship to #sisland_Isla Mona#.",
"Finally, I've got the opportunity to go there.",
"Yes. Don't miss this opportunity. As I already told you, only once per half-year a ship goes there.",
"Thank you. Return to your post, I'm going to deal with the issue.",
