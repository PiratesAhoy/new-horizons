"You are alive?!",
"Please, some water. I'm so thirsty.",
"Calm yourself, I have a flask of water with me, we are friends.",
"Thank you, thank you. I really needed that. But who are you?",
"I'm Johan Elting and I work for the Vice-Admiral of #sHavana#. Can you explain why you are here and what happened to the galleon?",
"I was injured and knocked overboard during the fight when pirates attacked the galleon. The ship was so damaged by the battle she sank shortly after the boarding. Despite wounded, I reached the shore but passed out shortly thereafter.",
"Were there any others who survived or maybe taken prisoner by the Pirates?",
"From what I could see from the water, they killed most of the crew but they took his Excellency, Cesario De Rosas.",
"Who is he?",
"The envoy of our King.",
"Damn it! Don't tell me he's the person who had to visit the colonies for your King.",
"Yes, that's right, it's him..",
"I asked you not to tell me that. You were headed to #sSanto Domingo#. What was the galleon doing on the North coast of #sisland_Hispaniola#?",
"The galleon had been pushed far to the North due to the storm.",
"And just after the storm, you met the pirates?",
"Right. We were an easy prey for them. We had a lot of damage to the sails and had lost steerage. We were repairing at sea when we were attacked.",
"I understand... By the way, do you know who led those pirates?",
"I heard someone shout 'Another easy prize, three cheers for Captain Roche Brasiliano'. The ship was black fast galleon.",
"The famous Roche Brasiliano himself. That's not a good news.",
"What do you plan to do? Please may I come with you, I have some severe wounds and have lost all?",
"I will sail to #sSanto Domingo# and talk to the governor. He will know what to do. Of course you will come with me, and you will be well looked after. Let's go now, we can't waste any time.",
