"Who are you? Don't you see I was talking to the Governor?",
"Sorry. You're Captain Morgan, aren't you?",
"Yes, I am. What do you want?",
"I know usually you prepare an expedition from time to time and I'd like to participate.",
"Are you Captain or sailor? If you are sailor, talk to my officer, he will find a post for you.",
"I'm Captain Johan Elting, not sailor.",
"Elting? The Dutch who worked for the Spanish?",
"Yes. How do you know?",
"Captain Bartolomeu talked about you a while ago.",
"Bartolomeu? Is he in #sRedmond#?",
"No, he's on a mission for me. But, follow me to the tavern, I have some questions for you.",
"Of course, Captain.",
"Life is odd sometimes, isn't it?",
"Why do you say this?",
"If I had met you a few months ago, I'd have had to kill you... And now, you want to work for me.",
"Indeed. But, I'd never have thought I could work for the Spanish authorities. Life is full of surprises.",
"Bartolomeu said you killed Vice-Admiral Benavides. Is it true?",
"Yes. He deserved it.",
"I won't say the opposite. The Brethren of the Coast thank you for having done this. He was a threat for us.",
"Does it mean you let me work for you?",
"Of course. Bartolomeu asserted you're an excellent Captain and I need them for my next expeditions.",
"By the way, in the townhall, you said Bartolomeu was on a mission for you. Where is he?",
"Far from here, in Vera Cruz.",
"In New Spain? Why?",
"There are some rumours the Spanish found an Aztec treasure a few months ago.",
"How did they find it?",
"We don't exactly know. I suppose it was hidden in a temple because they found it somewhere in the jungle.",
"I already found a temple on #sisland_Khael Roa#.",
"I'm not amazed. There are a lot of temples in this part of the world. However, each temple doesn't have a treasure. This one must have belonged to a King.",
"If you're right, it must be valuable.",
"I think so. That's why I sent Bartolomeu to Vera Cruz. He must confirm the Spaniards have conveyed the treasure there.",
"Why that town?",
"The treasure will be sent to Spain thanks to the Silver Fleet.",
"Humm... And as everyone knows, the fleet goes to Vera Cruz each year.",
"Right. It's also the nearest port of call where the treasure was found.",
"So, you're waiting for the Bartolomeu's confirmation before going there?",
"Yes. I'm preparing an expedition to attack Vera Cruz. But, we need to attack the town before the Silver Fleet arrives. Otherwise, we won't have enough forces to fight the Spaniards.",
"I understand.",
"However, there is a problem...",
"What?",
"According to my plans, Bartolomeu should have come back for a month. This lateness is worrying.",
"What do you think of doing?",
"I thought I could send someone to Vera Cruz to know if Bartolomeu is in trouble.",
"Do you want I go there?",
"Can you? Seeing you know him, you're the right man for this mission.",
"If you want, I can go right now.",
"Excellent! Remember, Captain! Whatever is the situation in Vera Cruz, I want you back as quickly as possible. I don't want the treasure leaves the Caribbean.",
"I'll remember. I'm going to prepare my leaving today. See you, Captain!",
"You are back, Elting and Bartolomeu! What are the news?",
"We won't attack Vera Cruz, Captain.",
"What? Don't tell me the treasure disappeared or left the Caribbean.",
"No, it's still in the Caribbean but in Cuba.",
"What is it doing there?",
"The Silver Fleet left Vera Cruz sooner than expected.",
"Gentlemen, we must quickly go to Havana. We don't know how long will be her stay. It could be our last lucky break to steal the treasure. Prepare your ships, we weigh anchor!",
"Yes, Captain.",
"Alright, the fleet is still in Havana. But we must know if the treasure is in the ships or on land and how long the fleet will stay, hoping we have enough time for the theft. Can you both get these information?",
"I think so. With Captain Bartolomeu, we'll find a stratagem.",
"Be quick! We can't indefinitely let our ships near Havana. This would be too dangerous.",
"Understood.",
"What is a priest doing in my ship?",
"He isn't priest. We dressed him with a robe only for leaving Havana. In fact, he's the captain of the Silver Fleet. We only found this solution to know where the treasure is.",
"Did you question him?",
"Not, yet. We prefer you do this.",
"I'll do it but his absence in Havana will alarm the authorities. We won't have much time to get the information.",
"Done! He understood I didn't feel like joking and he told where the treasure is.",
"In the ships?",
"No, it's in the El Morro fort.",
"Not better than the ships.",
"Worse, I would say. That's the reason they let it there during the stay.",
"Do you mean we must give up?",
"No, I don't. We'll attack the fort.",
"Are you sure we'll be able? You've just implied the fort is a big challenge.",
"Yes, but that isn't impossible. With a good plan, we can do it. The only problem is to prepare it as fast as possible. Tomorrow at night, we must act. Rest until tomorrow at noon, I'll call you for explaining the plan.",
"Gentlemen, I've got some work for you!",
"Is the plan ready?",
"Yes, we'll attack the fort by two sides. I'll command the troops in front of the main entry. My goal will be to attract the guards' attention. In the meantime, you and Bartolomeu with some of your crewmembers will penetrate into the fort by the opposite side to fight them on their back.",
"*Amazed tone* Captain, there is a cliff on that side.",
"I know. You'll approach the cliff with a small ship so as not to be detected by the guards. Arrived at the bottom of the cliff, you'll climb it thanks to the grapnels. The guards won't expect the enemy can come from that side.",
"I understand them.",
"Of course, it's dangerous but I have no other plan. If we want to win the battle we must surprise them. Otherwise, we'll have no chance.",
"Alright, we'll do at best.",
"Thank you, I knew I can count on you. Be confident, we'll succeed.",
"Elting?! That's you who destroyed the cannons?",
"Yes, Captain. Bartolomeu told me you were stopped by the cannons. But, no time for chatter, the Spanish must prepare a sortie. You should attack the fort!",
"I'm going right now to the main entrance. In the meantime, join Bartolomeu.",
"Well done, Elting! Now this floor is 'clean' we can go to the warehouse.",
"Look! The Aztec throne is here.",
"This throne must be worth a fortune.",
"Indeed. And we haven't still seen what the boxes hold.",
"Let's quickly carry the treasure to the beach. The Havana' soldiers must be warned of our attack.",
"Alright, we've almost finished the loading. After joining our ships, we'll head for #sRedmond#.",
"I succeeded in selling most of the loot but there is a problem...",
"What do you mean?",
"The Aztec throne is too valuable to be sold in the Caribbean. The shopkeeper of #sRedmond# was our unique possibility but he doesn't have enough money for that.",
"What will we do now?",
"In my opinion, it must be sold to a rich jeweller of London. Only those people could pay us the right price.",
"So, we should go to England?",
"Unnecessary. The Governor could send it to England in one of his warships. We'll get the money when the warship comes back.",
"Of course, we'll have to pay the Governor for the 'service'...",
"Indeed. I still need to talk to him but I bet a quarter of the sale.",
"humm...",
"I think it's the best solution. The throne will be safer in a British warship and we don't need to waste our time going to England. Do you agree?",
"I agree. What does Bartolomeu think?",
"I'm going to speak with him. If he agrees, I'll talk to the Governor.",
"Good news! The Governor has one of his warships that must go to England next month.",
"And the price for the service?",
"At the beginning, he wanted a third of the sale but I persuaded him to lower his part to a quarter.",
"As you thought.",
"Yes. Now, we must wait six months or more to receive the money. Until there, we can waste the money given by the shopkeeper.",
"How much?",
"450 000 gold coins. So, 150 000 for each one. Take your money!",
"Not bad.",
"And it's just the beginning because the throne is worth more than this amount. I expect 250 000 for each one when sold.",
"God! That's a big sum!",
"Yes, Captain. But, there is much to wait until we receive the money.",
"In the meantime, what will you do?",
"I'll rest in #sRedmond# these next weeks. Afterwards, I don't know... I don't have any new expeditions scheduled.",
"In this case, I'll see you in half-an-year for the loot sharing.",
"Thanks for all Captain. Good luck!",
"Goodbye!",
