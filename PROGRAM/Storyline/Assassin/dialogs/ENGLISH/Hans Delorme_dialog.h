"I'm Hans Delorme, the best smuggler in #sisland_Curacao#. I can find anything for you.",
"I'm not looking for goods at the moment, I will keep you in mind though. I am looking for someone.",
"Who, maybe I can help?",
"Roche Brasiliano.",
"I don't work for him, but I know he's not in the village at the moment.",
"What do you mean? Someone in #sWillemstad# said he lives here.",
"Yes, but he left #sisland_Curacao# a few days ago for a while.",
"Why?",
"No idea. Maybe, he wanted to attack some ships.. Anyway, I don't want to know. Since his arrival, he has almost taken over the village. Even the authorities avoid us now.",
"His house is the one guarded by two men, isn't it?",
"Yes, guarded by his men day and night.",
"He can't have only two men in the village?",
"No, there are more. Maybe a dozen or so. Of course, when he's in the village his crew are with him, around 350 men.",
"A lot of men.. Thank you Hans, I have things to do now.",
