"Well, well, well... Captain Elting. Do you enjoy your holiday in #sHavana#?",
"At the moment, Excellency, I have been 'sight seeing' at the jail.",
"Ha-ha-ha! you seem to have a sense of humour. A quality I appreciate. However, the reasons for our meeting are serious.",
"Excellency, I was acting in self-defence..",
"Stop! Captain Elting, you don't have to explain. A witness has come forward who confirms your story of the merchant trying to rob you.",
"Yes, Excellency. That is what I have been trying to tell everybody.",
"Just so, just so. However the fact remains you have killed a Spanish citizen and smuggling is against the law, and I cannot let either pass.. unless..",
"Unless what your Excellency?",
"Unless you bond yourself to the Spanish Crown as a mercenary and serve Spain for a period of ten years. What say you?",
"And the option?",
"That you and your crew hang tomorrow morning.",
"[THINKS: Some option!] You are very convincing. I would be pleased to serve the Spanish Throne your Excellency.",
"You are a reasonable man. I will need to take some precautions.",
"What precautions?",
"Your crew will be Spanish as will be your officer. Let's say, I just want to make sure of your loyalty.",
"I understand, Excellency.",
"Remember you are lucky, captain! If I hadn't learnt of your prior military service, this meeting wouldn't have happened, instead you and your crew would have been hung.",
"Could I know who told you my military past?",
"This is what you'll learn over the next months. As you know, the Spanish colonies are preyed on by more and more by pirates and hostile nations. In order to fight our enemies, the Spanish Crown created in the Caribbean an intelligence service composed of dozens of spies.",
"Thanks to them you found out about my past?",
"Right. I know the Dutch authorities have never really rewarded you for your merits when you were a soldier. And this has been confirmed by some of your crewmembers these last days.",
"I'm quite impressed, Excellency.",
"Thank you for your compliment. But now, you need to prove your reputation is founded on fact and not just rumours.",
"How?",
"Accomplishing a mission of course. An easy mission by the way; you have to meet a Spanish spy in #sisland_Cayman# and bring a report about the military activities on that island back to #sHavana#.",
"When do I have to go?",
"Right now. You have one month to accomplish this mission. Otherwise, you'll be regarded as deserter and hunted by my soldiers. Do you understand Captain?",
"Yes, Excellency.",
"Alright Captain. Go to the shipyard so that you meet my personal shipwright, Captain Damski. He will teach you about your new ship, a new kind of xebec. Afterwards, join your new crewmembers and officer in the port. And before I forget, take these 2000 gold coins in order to pay your men or purchase new items. Don't think you can rely only on my rewards. You will also have to liberate money and supplies from our enemies, attacking hostile ships for instance.",
"As you like, Excellency.",
"Ha! Captain Elting, Have you got the report?",
"Yes, Excellency.",
"Thank you Captain. Did you have any problems during the mission?",
"Just an unexpected incident. I've had to kill an English officer to protect our spy.",
"Good initiative! It seems I was right to trust in your ability. I think I can give you a new mission.",
"What kind of mission?",
"A rescue mission. We have a problem with our spy in #sOxbay#; he disappeared. We don't know if he deserted, was arrested by the English authorities or even kidnapped by some brigands.",
"If I find him what do you wish me to do with him?",
"Bring him here to me. If he deserted, he will be hung. If something else has happened, he will need to be posted to a new island.",
"I understand, Excellency.",
"Take this money as reward for your first mission. Now, you can go Captain. You have two months to accomplish this mission.",
"I'll be back soon.",
"Back at last, Captain! I see you have found Pelagius.",
"Indeed, Excellency. He was kidnapped by some brigands in #sOxbay#.",
"My belief that Pelagius was not a deserter has been proven sound. Captain, your reward is well deserved.",
"Thank you, Excellency.",
"You have proved my faith in you has been justified. I think I can give you more important missions and I've got just the one for you. I want you kill a former spy working for me.",
"What did he do so that you want I kill him?",
"He deserted our side and I never forgive traitors.",
"Where can I find him?",
"At #sPort au Prince#. I think you'll find him in the fort because he works as soldier.",
"In the fort? But there is a whole garrison there!",
"I know this, I'm not crazy Captain. For this work, your officer Chico Cois will give you a special weapon that allows to kill a dozen soldiers in a few seconds. He will give you further details outside. You have one month to complete the task and return.",
"As you wish, Excellency.",
"Captain Elting, you have disappointed me and I never forgive failure. The gallows is waiting for you.", 
"You are back, Captain! Did you meet Gabriel Brugera?",
"Yes, Excellency. Your honour has been upheld, I killed him at the fort, what a coward, he couldn't even meet me in a duel.",
"Congratulations Captain! Take these 5000 gold coins for this work. While you were accomplishing your mission, I received a letter from our government in Madrid. Apparently, a secret meeting occurred in Paris between the Portuguese ambassador and a French minister three months ago.",
"How can this affect us here?",
"As you know, Portugal is at war with us but not France...",
"And you think the French King may be preparing for war with Spain?",
"No, it isn't the interest of France to do that. However their king, Louis XIV, could discreetly help Portugal and its colonies sending money, ammunition and weapons.",
"And with additional resourses, Portugal can prevent Spain from taking #sisland_Conceicao# for instance.",
"Indeed, now you understand why that meeting is so important. Hence, your next mission is to sail to #sMarigot#.",
"Why there?",
"It is usually the first port where the French ships coming from Europe moor. So it's the perfect place to start. You are to find proof that France is helping Portugal and what resources they intend to send to #sisland_Conceicao#.",
"And if I discover that the French are helping the Portuguese colony?",
"You have full authority to prevent any help reaching there.. without prejudice. In #sMarigot#, meet one of our agents: Tello Basadre. He'll help you in this task.", 
"I'm going right now.",
"Captain Elting! What news do you bring, did you find any proof of France's treachery?",
"You were right, Excellency. The French were helping the Portuguese colony.",
"What kind of help exactly, please tell me in detail what you have found out?",
"A lineship. Here's the order of mission I stole in #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#. I tried to abort their help by killing the captain of the ship on the island. Unfortunately, the governor of #sFalaise de Fleur# commanded that the mission be continued without delay.",
"So the lineship went to #sisland_Conceicao#? Did you fail your mission to prevent France from helping them?",
"No, I infiltrated the lineship at #sConceicao# and sabotaged her.",
"Sabotaged the ship? How did you do that?!",
"Putting two bombs into the ship.",
"Well, it seems you are becoming one of my best soldiers. Congratulations Captain, accept these 15000 gold coins as reward. I will send to Spain the order of mission you gave me as evidence of the secret alliance between France and Portugal. My King will deal with the French in due course.",
"Thank you, Excellency. The reward is most welcome, do you have a new mission for me?",
"Yes. I want you kill Mateus Santos.",
"Who is he? I've never heard this name.",
"That's normal, he's a really discreet person. In fact, he's a former Spanish mercenary.",
"Did he work for you?",
"No. He worked for the governor of #sisland_Isla Muelle# a few years ago. But, his enthusiasm for killing all and sundry reflected badly on our nation and he was let go. Afterwards, he created a society of assassins for hire, he has no morals. He has recently been working for the English and has killed some important Spanish officials.",
"... and he is still working for our enemies?",
"Yes, by the way it is his men that do the killing, he is the head and we need to cut off the head.",
"Do you know where he lives?",
"Unfortunately, no. He regularly changes his headquarters. Our agents have found out that a pirate living in #sTortuga# may know where he is, or how to contact him.",
"This pirate, how would he know?",
"We have been told that he works for Santos as recruiter.",
"So, I should go there and tell him I want to work for his chief.",
"Indeed, Captain. And when you have the opportunity, kill Santos. But be careful, this man is really dangerous.",
"Yes, Excellency.",
"Finally, you have returned, Captain! Did you find Santos and complete your mission?",
"Yes, Excellency. He was constantly protected by a group of cutthroats so I had to wait the right moment to kill him.",
"I knew this could be a dangerous task but you overcame the trials. Take these 15000 gold coins. Captain, I need your services again.",
"What do you exactly want?",
"The governor of #sSanto Domingo# is an old friend and he would like some help. In fact, he's looking for someone.",
"Who's this 'someone'?",
"That's the problem. He's a very important person : the envoy of his majesty Charles II.",
"The envoy of the King is in the Caribbean?",
"Yes. As you know, Philip IV died a short time ago and Charles II ascended the throne. His first decision was to conduct a review of all Spanish colonies around the world. And for the Caribbean, he sent the envoy who arrived at #sIsla Muelle# two months ago. He started his visit there and should have gone to #sSanto Domingo# afterwards. However, despite leaving #sisland_Isla Muelle#, he hasn't arrived at #sSanto Domingo# yet. Worried by the delay the governor started his search for the envoy's ship, it may have been damaged.",
"And he didn't find anything..",
"Indeed. This situation is really embarrassing not only for the #sSanto Domingo# governor but for all the Spanish authorities in the Caribbean. Your mission is to find the envoy and why he disappeared.",
"I'll start with the #sSanto Domingo# governor and sail as quickly as I can, Excellency.",
"Captain Elting, did you find the envoy?",
"No, Excellency but I know Roche Brasiliano kidnapped him.",
"How?!",
"He boarded the envoy's ship off #sisland_Hispaniola#.",
"What nerve that bastard of a pirate has!",
"And before I left #sSanto Domingo#, the governor received a letter asking a large ransom for his release.",
"Outrageous! This pirate has exceeded all limits. Find and free the envoy but I also want you to capture Roche and bring him to me. I will have a warm welcome waiting for him.",
"I would like to comply, Excellency, but I don't know where to start my search.",
"Well, maybe you should team up with Nicholas Butcher. Roche may prove too much for one man.",
"Who?",
"He's my longest serving mercenary, he has a lot of experience in hunting pirates.",
"Where can I find him?",
"He's here in town. I will summon him.",
"Alright, Captain. Now, you know what to do. I'm looking forward to you and Nicholas bringing back the envoy and Roche to #sHavana#.",
"Congratulations, Captain. Once more you accomplished the mission.",
"With the help of Captain Butcher! I couldn't have released the envoy without his help.",
"I know and I didn't forget to reward him when he came with his Excellency Cesario de Rosas. Take these 20000 gold coins but this is not the only reward. The governor, himself, wants to give you something.",
"Time has come for Roche Brasiliano to pay for his crimes. Do you want to witness his hanging?",
"No, Excellency. I'd prefer to rejoin my crew.",
"As you like. I won't have any new mission for you for over a month. But in the meantime, I want you increase your skills at sea by attacking hostile ships.",
"Welcome Captain Elting! Now, I can tell you what's your new mission. Do you know #sisland_Isla Mona#?",
"Yes. The island is between #sisland_Isla Muelle# and #sisland_Hispaniola#.",
"That's right, exactly in an important Spanish route. The problem is the British have been occupying the island for a year.",
"I thought the Spaniards were there.",
"No. Seeing #sisland_Isla Mona# is small and very mountainous, we didn't colonize it.",
"Why did the British go there?",
"To build a fort at the top of a cliff, but most important, to install two big cannons there; Cannons made in England only for this purpose.",
"And I suppose thanks to their range they can stop any hostile landing and cover the Spanish trading route by the way.",
"You catch on quickly, Captain. I need you destroy those cannons.",
"I could discreetly moor there at night...",
"No, that's too dangerous. The island is surrounded by cliffs and rocks except for a small shore used as port.",
"How else can I get there to complete the mission?",
"The island is ruled by the #sisland_Antigua#'s Admiral. Meet this Admiral and tell him you want to work for him as privateer. When he gives you a mission for #sisland_Isla Mona#, you'll know what to do.",
"I understand, Excellency. I sail for #sisland_Antigua#, on the tide.",
"Wait! Do you remember Pelagius Lizarraga?",
"The spy I rescued in #sOxbay#?",
"Indeed. Now, he works in the Naval Base of #sisland_Antigua#. You should meet him before talking to the Admiral. He can give you some useful information.",
"I look forward to meeting him again.",
"Captain! Have you got good news?",
"Indeed, Excellency. The cannons of #sisland_Isla Mona# are no longer a threat to the Spanish ships.",
"Incredible! You do me proud. His majesty Charles II will be pleased to know this. With the cannons destroyed, it will be possible to send some warships and evict the British. Your reward has been well earned again, 25000 gold coins.",
"Thank you, Excellency. Maybe, you could send the ships right now. The English Navy won't be a danger for them.",
"Why do you say that?",
"The Admiral of Antigua is preparing a fleet for #sisland_Khael Roa#.",
"#sisland_Khael Roa#? Why do they want to send a fleet there?",
"The French are already on the island and the English want to settle the island too.",
"Interesting...",
"I fought the French with an English Captain and I think the French will come back soon with a large force.",
"Maybe, they will send 'La Couronne' to #sisland_Khael Roa#.",
"'La Couronne'? What is it?",
"The most powerful ship of the French Navy. The ship arrived in the Caribbean a few months ago.. If there is a battle between the French and the English, I'm certain the French will send their best ship. It's a great opportunity to capture the ship. And, I want you do that!",
"What?! As you said, it's the most powerful ship belonging to the French. How can I do this? Anyway, we are not at war with France.",
"I know we are not officially at war with the French. But, you forget they have a secret alliance with the Portuguese. If we capture their best ship, they could rethink their alliance..",
"Maybe, but I still think it will be hard to capture the ship.",
"Not so hard, if you take advantage of the battle between them and the English. Let the English weaken 'La Couronne' first. Afterwards, hoist the English flag and board her.",
"Indeed, that's the only way.",
"I know the mission is dangerous, Captain. But, the Spanish authorities won't forget to reward you.",
"Very well, Excellency.. I'll go to #sisland_Khael Roa# I have a slim chance of seizing 'La Couronne'.",
"Congratulations Captain Elting! You seized 'La Couronne'. King Charles II will be happy to know this. Of course, I have to take the ship but accept these 30000 gold coins.",
"Thank you, Excellency. But, this ship is worth more than 30000 gold coins, my crew will be furious for me giving away such a prize.",
"I know Captain. However, we cannot keep it. As I said, 'La Couronne' will be exchanged for a new relationship between France and Portugal.", 
"I understand.",
"At the moment, I haven't any new mission for you. Your mission now is to attack any hostile ships of the Spanish Crown.",
"(Vice-Admiral Benavides talking to the soldier)",
"What are you talking, soldier?!",
"Dutch soldiers in Cuba?! That must be a raid from a ship. Captain Padilla go with your men there and eliminate this threat. Captain Elting! You'll accompany and help them.",
"Congratulations Captain Padilla and Elting! These last months the Dutch attacked many times Cuba but it was near Santiago. Now, they don't hesitate to attack near #sHavana#. Their recklessness will be punished! A decision must be taken by the Spanish authorities. Captain Elting, you'll stay in #sHavana# until I call you over the next days.",
"Ha! Captain, come in! We were waiting for you. I and Governor Vadés, we are preparing a plan to punish the Dutch.",
"What plan, Excellency?",
"Our plan is to capture Oranjestad and make Aruba a Spanish base for preventing the Dutch threat near Cuba.",
"Capturing Oranjestad?!",
"Yes. It's an ambitious plan but we need to strike them hard.",
"How do you think of setting about it?",
"We know Oranjestad hasn't good defences. However, there is a Dutch fleet off the island that could prevent a landing of our forces. So, the plan is letting the Dutch thinking the Spaniards will attack #sisland_Douwesen#. Thus, most of the Dutch ships would go to #sisland_Douwesen# to defend the island.",
"...Seems to be a good option. How to lure them we want to attack #sisland_Douwesen#?",
"You'll go to #sisland_Douwesen#, find an official and kidnap him. You'll tell him he will be taken to #sHavana# so that the Spaniards can know the defences of the island for a future landing. But, you'll let him escape at night from your ship so that he can rejoin his compatriots in #sDouwesen#.",
"Interesting...",
"Afterwards, you leave #sisland_Douwesen# and see the Indians of Aruba.",
"Why them?",
"We know they aren't happy by the Dutch presence in the island and their help could be valuable for the operation. You'll tell them you work for a nation, without saying is Spain, and you'll reward them with a lot of money if they decide to help us against the Dutch.",
"Afterwards, I return to #sHavana# ?",
"Yes, I'll give you further instructions. You can go right now, Captain. Take these 50000 gold coins for the Indians before.",
"Yes, Excellency. See you soon!",
"What are the news, Captain?",
"I accomplished both missions. I gave the wrong information to a Dutch officer of #sisland_Douwesen# and found a tribe in Aruba who accepted to help us.",
"Excellent, Captain. So, everything is alright?",
"Almost... The Indians want more gold. I tried to negotiate but they don't accept less than 100000 gold coins.",
"Humm... Don't worry, Governor Vadés will accept to pay the difference. This mission is essential and 50000 additional gold coins won't stop the operation. You have one month for doing anything you want, required time to confirm the plan is working. I must send some spies in Aruba and Bonaire over the next days.",
"Welcome back, captain Elting!",
"Thank you, Excellency. Otherwise, do you know if the plan worked?",
"Yes, as it was planned. The Dutch almost moved all the ships from Aruba to #sisland_Douwesen#.",
"And the preparations for the operation?",
"Everything is ready. Captain Padilla commands a fleet of three galleons. They are waiting for you in the port. Take this gold in order to pay the Indians, weigh anchor and set sail for Aruba. No need to waste more time.",
"Here you are! Tell me everything. Did Captain Padilla capture Oranjestad?",
"Yes, Excellency. However, I must inform you of a serious problem.",
"What happened?",
"Captain Padilla let his men commit war crimes in Oranjestad. Many civilians have been killed without any reasons by Spanish soldiers.",
"I recognize Captain Padilla is a tough officer but an excellent one.",
"I think you didn't understand what I said Excellency, I'm talking of WAR CRIMES. Captain Padilla should be punished to let that happen. He has no honour!",
"No, no and no! I won't punish him, he's too important for fighting our enemies. And let me say, I don't like the way you talk to me, I'm not anybody. Remember that!",
"[THINKS: Go to Hell!] I'm awfully disappointed by your decision.",
"Captain, don't exceed the limits. NOBODY under my command can discuss my decisions. This subject is definitively settled!",
"Well, you need to change your mind, and I've got something for that. You'll arrest a dangerous pirate.",
"You are very silent, Captain. May I remind you still have to cooperate to be a free man?",
"[THINKS: Bastard like Padilla, the Vice-Admiral]... Who's the pirate?",
"Bartolomeu o Portugues. You know him?",
"I've heard he accomplished some bold feats.",
"I call that : acts of piracy. Stealing goods and ships to the Spanish authorities, killing soldiers, threatening officers... He even dared to free his crew in this town.", 
"He must be courageous or reckless.",
"Or stupid...",  
"Have you got any clues to start my search?",
"In fact, the search has already started.", 
"How?",
"Nicholas Butcher, the English mercenary who helped you for the Roche Brasiliano's arrest is at #sIsla Muelle# looking for any information. So, you'll see him in order to be your partner in this mission. Take this gold, Captain. You'll need it over the next weeks. This search will last for a good while. Good luck Captain!",
"Already back?! You arrested Bartolomeu?",
"No, unfortunately. I only arrested his officer in #sisland_Conceicao#.",
"That's annoying. And his officer didn't give you any information about him?",
"He refuses. He even prefers to die than helping us.",
"Where is he?",
"Captain Butcher took him to the jail. I think we should use him for capturing Bartolomeu.",
"How?",
"In the past, he already put in danger his life for freeing his crew in Havana. Let's him come here again but this time we won't let him escape.",
"You're right, Captain. However, we should also use another person he appreciates a lot.",
"Who?",
"Captain Lalliere, a French corsair. We know she was his partner for the warehouses' attack in Santiago. She's a friend and he usually sees her.",
"Why not... But, where can I find her?",
"I've got a good news because I saw yesterday a spy coming from Alice and he told me Captain Lalliere was there.",
"That's a great opportunity, Excellency.",
"Indeed. You and Captain Butcher go immediately to Puerto la Cruz.",
"Puerto la Cruz ? But, you said she was in Alice.",
"Yes, but ask help before to the Governor of Puerto la Cruz. He'll be useful for the capture of Roxanne Lalliere. Just something else, after arresting Roxanne Lalliere, wait for captain Padilla at Puerto la Cruz.",
"Why?",
"Captain Padilla must arrive from Santo Domingo over the next days. I want he takes her back to Havana in his galleon instead of your ship. His ship is powerfully armed and I'm sure nobody will try to board her to free Roxanne Lalliere.",
"Welcome back Captain Elting! All the town already knows you defeated Bartolomeu o Portugues.",
"Well, news quickly spread here.",
"First, take these 80 000 gold coins for the death of Bartolomeu and the arrest of Roxanne Lalliere, of course.",
"Thank you Excellency but without Captain Butcher I wouldn't have accomplished this mission.",
"Don't worry. I already gave him a reward. Captain Butcher is my oldest mercenary but he's still one of my best soldiers. However, there are another good news for you. Governor Vadés wants to speak with you.",
"I see you captured 'La Couronne' but you are not captaining her. Please return after you have her under complete control.",
"Alright Captain. Go to the shipyard so that you may meet my personal shipwright, Captain Damski. He will teach you about your new ship, a new kind of xebec. Afterwards, join your new crewmembers and officer in the port. And before I forget, take this Letter of Marque provided by the governor and these 2000 gold coins in order to pay your men or purchase new items. Don't think you can rely only on my rewards. You will also have to liberate money and supplies from our enemies, attacking hostile ships for instance.",
"Captain, you still fail to present 'La Couronne' to me. Either bring me that ship or bring me an identical French war galleon!",
