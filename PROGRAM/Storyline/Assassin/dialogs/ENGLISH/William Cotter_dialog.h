"William Cotter?",
"Yes, what do you want?",
"The governor of Puerto la Cruz told to see you.",
"I knew you'll come. Who's the person you want to kidnap?",
"A French woman corsair called Roxanne Lalliere. Did you see her?",
"Humm... The only woman captain I saw coming these last days is a Dutch tradeswoman.",
"She must be her. Seeing the relations between England and France, she uses the Dutch flag like cover. Where is she?",
"She's in the tavern with his officer.",
"At night, she sleeps in the tavern?",
"No, she usually returns to her ship.",
"Alright, we'll have the opportunity of ambushing when she comes back to the ship. The only problem are the guards patrolling the town...",
"Don't worry, I can temporarily attract them outside the town during your operation.",
"How?",
"I'll tell them I saw a Spanish patrol in the jungle near the gates and I'll take them there.",
"Good. I only need to wait she leaves the tavern tonight.",
