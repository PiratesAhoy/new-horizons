"Fine, fine. I'm listening.",
"I'm looking for a crew. Maybe you can tell me who's looking for a ship.",
"My last voyage left me short on crewmen. Point me to suitable cannon fodder here in your tavern, and I'll be on my way.",
"I just need some information, if you've got a minute.",
"Do you have a cot I don't have to share with a thousand insects?",
"I need a clean room with a bed. Emphasis on clean.",

"I'm looking for a certain man that came to the island not long ago. He's Italian, an older man. Does that ring a bell?",
"I'm interested in someone named Artois Voysey. He is a tall young man with dark hair. Has he showed up around here?",
"I need some work. Don't you know any rich boy on this island who is afraid to travel alone?",
"Let's change tack, and talk about something else.",
"Yes, I've seen him, but I doubt it's going to make you happy.\nYou see, this lad came in here with some scoundrel, and five minutes later the door swings open, and two villains in black masks come in.\nThey took your Artois with them, and heavily wounded his friend. He's in one of the rooms upstairs right now.",
"Thousand curses! I need to see him! Maybe he knows who these masked troublemakers are.",
"Now, let me think.... Oh, but of course! Senor ",

"Quiet! If you value your life, you won't say that name out loud again. Look! Did you see that man who just left the tavern? Get away! Go now, or you'll bring the sky down on my head!",
"Pull yourself together, man! You're quaking in your boots...and you don't even know anything useful, do you? Bah. Goodbye!",
"Relax! I can see you're not going to be of any use to me. Goodbye!",
"Sorry, but it's very late. Everyone's found a place to spend the night by now. Come back in the morning if you like. Or you can spend a night here in the tavern.",
"Maybe I will. Do you have a room?",
"I might just do that. But for now, I've got some more questions.",
"As it happens, I do have a vacancy. How long did you plan to stay?",
"Until morning.",
"Just until night falls.",
"It'll cost you 5 gold.",
"Fine. Here's your money.",
"Alas, it looks like a bed is beyond my reach at the moment. I'll just sleep in the tavern-hall.",
"You want how much?! Do I get a fruit basket with that? Thanks, but I'll just sleep in the tavern-hall.",
"I'll consider it. Meanwhile, I need some more information.",
"It'll cost you 5 gold.",

"Sadly, that's more than I care to spend. I'll sleep in the tavern-hall.",
"What's that for, a king-size room? No, thanks, I'll sleep in the tavern hall.",
"I'll think about it.",
"This is a respectable establishment! Stop at once, or I'll call for the guards!",
"All right, all right. I'm leaving!",
"If there is such a person, he might prefer to avoid attracting attention with so many consorts - as I'd expect you to know.",
"Yes, I forgot. All right, I'll come back later, when I've got fewer ships, ha-ha.",
"I don't want to help you, with all the harm you've done to my country.",
"Alright. Farewell.",
"Your hands are covered in blood. Do you seriously think that somebody will travel in your company?",
"You are right, everybody is afraid of me! Ha-ha!",
"You came just in time. One merchant here was searching to sail in company with just the right companions. You'd better talk to him. Here he is, coming into the tavern.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is nobody for that moment, Maybe next time.",
"Hmm. Then I will wait.",
"Do you know if Bartolomeu o Portugues was here recently?",
"Recently? Don't you know he's here?",
"What? No, I didn't know. When did he come?",
"Today, with the envoy of our governor. They were going to the townhall when I saw them outside the tavern.",
"Do you know why Bartolomeu came to #sConceicao#?",
"I have no idea, my friend. I'm just the tavern keeper.",
"Alright... But, can you tell me which ship moored in the port is his?",
