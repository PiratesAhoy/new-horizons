"Hello... Captain?",
"Captain ",
"I perfectly know what you're looking for: Miss Justine Le Moigne.",
"Right. Who told you this?",
"The governor of #sPhilipsburg#. I can say that he works for me.",
"I understand. I had the feeling he concealed the truth from me. But why did you kidnap the Governor's daughter? For a ransom?", 
"I'm not a pirate like others, Captain, I was looking for love and I found it since I met her.",
"And she loves you?",
"Humm..humm... not for now but she'll love me in the future. I think she doesn't seem to appreciate life aboard...",
"Yes? Maybe I can solve your problem.",
"How?!",
"Leave her temporarily under the authority of the governor of #sPhilipsburg# and in exchange I'll convince Governor Le Moigne to give up on bringing her back to #sFalaise De Fleur#. As proof of goodwill, let me take her to #sPhilipsburg#.",
"It's too risky. I don't trust you.",
"Why? While I was waiting for you, a crewmember told me you like playing liar's dice.",
"Yes, but why do you talk of this now?",
"Whoever wins will take Justine to #sPhilipsburg#.",
"I accept your offer to leave her under the authority of the governor of #sPhilipsburg# but I'll take her there.",
"Are you afraid of playing with me?",
"Are you joking? I consider myself as the best player. Take the cup and the dice, I'm going to teach you a lesson.",
"How many rounds?",
"Only one. Let's play! I bid four fours.",
"humm...I bid four fives.",
"Ahah! Seven fives!",
"Eight fives!",
"You lie! Show me your dice!",
"I have four fives and you too. You lost.",
"Dash it! Ok, you can take her but don't try to deceive me otherwise I'll kill you!",
"Understood, see you at #sPhilipsburg#.",
"Traitor! Do you think you can take me for a ride?!",
"Sorry, Captain!",
"And you think I'm going to forgive what you did?!",
"I'm not sorry for what I did but for what I'm going to do.",
"What did you do?",
"I perfectly know what I did. Justine told me during the voyage you can only set foot on land once every ten years, so when I saw you near the sea I immediately thought to push you into the water. Now, you can't recapture her.",
"DAMN YOU ", 
"You look and smell like a drowned rat! Here are some new clothes. Anyway, you're lucky to be alive... and even more lucky to have found me.",
"Who are you? Where am I?",
"I am Davy Jones, some say king of the sea, and you may be where ever I prefer. You are only here because it suits my purpose.",
"Well that's good news and bad news. I was on my way to be hung, so I am saved from that, but I have no ship, it was burnt and sunk. I don't know what to do next.",
"A sad tale indeed, but I know of that. I can be of assistance in your hour of need... for a price.",
"Assistance I could use. But at what price, how much money do you want?",
"I have no need for money. I need you to sail with me. I am on a quest and am in need of a good crew and men like you.",
"I know I am in no position to bargain here, but, I am my own man, and I have matters to take care of so I don't think I could sign on with you Sir.",
"Listen to my terms. I will raise your ship and give you thirteen years to take care of your own affairs. Then you will give me your soul and sail with me for one hundred years.",
"You will allow me thirteen years on my own with no interference?",
"That is my word. Decide now or I will leave you here... to an uncertain fate.",
"Very well, I accept your terms. [THINKS: Thirteen years, that's more than enough time to get out of the conditions.] ",
"No, that is too high a cost. I will fend for myself and rely on lady fortune.",
"So be it... After your actions, you should consider joining the Brethren of the Coast at the pirate settlement on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#. You may wish to reacquaint yourself with Captain Barbossa as well.",
"Where do I find him, and how do I get back to my ship?",
"Like any famous pirate, he can often be found in the tavern of #sTortuga#. As for your ship, turn round and walk towards the shore and then into the sea. You will find your ship waiting there.",
"Very well.",
"Then you will see now how much lady fortune thinks of you! If you reconsider, you may yet find me in my Secret Hidehout near a native temple.",
"It shall not come to that. I make my own path, that I promise!",
"Did you really think you could escape from me if you continued to sail the seas ",
"Um...",
"Huh Hah... Deal! You shall never hear from me again Captain ",
", unless our agreement is broken!",
"That is good to hear.",
"Huh Hah... Fine! I'll be seeing you again ",
"I can't wait.",
"Hello again Captain Jack Sparrow, it is I Davy Jones, I have returned to ferrying the souls lost at sea to the Locker but have come here as I see you are in need of help.",
"Well that's good news and bad news. I was on my way to be hung, so I am saved from that, but I have no ship. She was burnt and sunk. I don't know what to do next.",
"Well Jack Sparrow, I shall raise your ship from the Locker, this is in thanks for you bringing me Cal.. um Tia Dalma. And take these clothes too.",
"Thank you very much, Davy Jones.",
"Hello... Captain Jack Sparrow",
"How did you know my name... savvy?",
"You do remember the debt that you payed me? I raised your ship for you! Now as to why you're here now: I know perfectly well who you're looking for: Miss Justine Le Moigne.",
"Ah yes, that deal! Who told you that I was looking for Miss Le Moigne?",
"Decided you may have made a mistake when we first met? Figured it is time to meet your destiny after all?",
"Indeed it seems my endeavours have not led much of anywhere.",
"Remember, you have 13 years and not a day longer. After that, your soul belongs to me!",
"Ah, yes, how could I forget. I shall be looking forward to that with bated breath.",
"Do you fear death?  Do you fear that dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished. I can offer you... an escape-uh.. [Smokes a pipe using tentacles]",
"The last glimmer of moonlight that dies in the dawning of your final day. And then - Judgement. All your deeds laid bare. Your sins punished. I can offer you an escape..",
"Do you not fear death? [Smokes a pipe]",
"To the depths with him.",
"Life is cruel. Why should the afterlife be any different? You cling to the pain of life, and fear death. I offer you the Choice. Join my crew ... and postpone judgement. One hundred years before the mast.",
"Will you serve?",
"You are neither dead, nor dying. What is your purpose here?",
"Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.",
"Again. What is your purpose here?",
"Jack Sparrow sent me ... to settle his debt.",
"Did he now? I am sorely tempted to accept that offer.",
"You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our agreement.",
"Technically I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.",
"Then you were a poor captain. But a captain nonetheless. Have you not introduced yourself all this time as Captain Jack Sparrow?",
"Not that I recall, why do you ask? You have my payment. One soul, to serve on your ship. He is already over there.",
"One soul is not the same as another.",
"Ah, so we've established the proposal is sound in principle. Now we're just haggling over price.",
"As has been the case before, I am oddly compelled to listen to you.",
"Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?",
"One hundred souls. Three days.",
"You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started, right off.",
"I keep the boy. A good faith payment. That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go.",
"What? Have you met Will Turner? He's noble and heroic, a terrific soprano ... he's worth at least four.",
"I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live  with this? Can you condemn an innocent man, a friend-uh, to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam free?",
"Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?",
"Three days... Three days.",
"I'd embrace you but I fear it might stick.",
