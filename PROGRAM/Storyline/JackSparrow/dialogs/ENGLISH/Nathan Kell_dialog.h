"We need to get going.",
"Alright, Captain.",
"So you found my room. Stop staring about and state who you are.",
"A friend of Captain Petros and Sir Christopher Mings. Anamaria told me you were in town, and Captain Damski told me where to find you.",
"Oh! They did? Then we both would be...?",
"Members of the Brotherhood.",
"Correct! Who are you? And what business do you have here?",
"I am Captain ",
", and Captain Petros said you had part of a map that you could give me.",
"Ah! The Cortez treasure map. Yes I do have part of it. Here it is. Be careful though, there is more than one treasure out there and one of them is cursed.",
"Cursed? What do you mean cursed?",
"There is a treasure on the Isla de Muerte, an enormous hoard, but it is cursed. Those who take it unlawfully, cannot be killed, but they cannot die either, so are cursed to walk the earth forever.",
"That's interesting! There is a Captain named Barbossa who I think is after the Cortez treasure, perhaps I could pull a switch on him.",
"Barbossa! Well, well. I have had the pleasure of meeting him. He is not a friend of the Brotherhood.",
"Thank you for your help. I will leave you and your quarters now.",
"Not so fast Captain ",
".",
" I assume you have more than just the one part of the map I gave you, and we can't let those fall into Beckett's hands.",
"It won't be just the map he's after. You see I sort of 'borrowed' his ship and haven't returned it yet. I couldn't return it really so I thought I'd make it my own, ey.",
"Barnacles and Bilge Rats! It gets worse by the minute... Where is this 'borrowed' ship now?",
"She's moored in the bay by the lighthouse. Anamaria is waiting for me there too.",
"You've brought us a lot of unwanted attention ",
"Captain ",
" if you please. [THINKS: Why does everyone forget that part?]",
"Whatever! Right, here is the best plan I can come up with at the moment. Captain Damski, see what you can do to get Anamaria and CAPTAIN ",
"'s ship out to sea before Beckett finds them, you know where to go to. In the meantime, CAPTAIN ",
" you and I will make our way through the jungle, to see Sir Mings in #sOxbay#. He will know what to do next.",
"Sounds like a plan to me. Let's go then.",
"Stay back a bit. It will be better if I explain things to Mings.",
"Er... Yes, I suppose it would.",
"Don't look now... but that Naval Officer over there is one of Beckett's men. Bligh his name is. He's known as the 'Watcher', which is also the name of his ship. ",
"I've seen him around before. It looks like he's going to follow us.",
"What can I do for you, Captain?",
"I've killed the Pirate Lord of the Atlantic Ocean, Gentleman Jocard.",
"You killed a Pirate Lord? That is serious. You will have to answer to the Brethren Court for this!",
"In my defence, so-called 'Gentleman' Jocard was no gentleman. He was a slaver.",
"Oh? That is a different matter. We don't tolerate slavery, we stand for freedom for all. Do you have his piece of 8?",
"Right here.",
"Very well. Then there is just the matter of a replacement Pirate Lord of the Atlantic Ocean.\nCap'n Drow has shown himself able to take great responsibility. You will find him in the fort office. Go through the landward gate and turn left, then follow the path to the fort.",
"Thank you. I'll head for the fort now.",
