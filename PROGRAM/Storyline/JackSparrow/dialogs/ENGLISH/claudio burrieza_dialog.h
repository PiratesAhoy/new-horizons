"Ah! A new visitor in my tavern! Welcome, ",
"! The finest hospitality in the archipelago is at your disposal!",
"Hello. My name is ",
".",
"Thank you. My name is ",
".",
"You're most welcome. Please, have a seat, drink some good rum, try one of my specialties! You'll be glad you did.",
"I'm glad to see you again, ",
". Take any of the free tables and rest your bones.",
"Oh, it's you! Haven't seen you for ages. Can I start you off with a glass of wine to wet your whistle?",
"If it's all the same to you, I'd like to get straight to business.",
"Time is short, friend, and I have serious matters to discuss.",
"I'm sorry. I'm too busy for hospitality at the moment.",
"Settle down. I just dropped in to see who was here; I'm already leaving.",
"Pleased to meet you, ",
". My name is ",
".",
"Of course, ",
", you're the boss. How can I help you?",
"I'm looking to add to my crew. Could you point me to anyone who might be looking for work?",
"Recent battles have left me short-handed. I need to find some lads who are looking for a job.",
"I'd like to talk business.",
"Do you have a room available? I'd like to stay here for a while.",
"I'm looking for a clean room with a clean bed. Nothing more, nothing less.",
"I don't have time to talk right now. I'll come by later.",
"Sorry, I'm busy now. But I'll be back for a chat when I'm free.",
"Indeed! And what business is that?",
"I'm looking for a gentleman you might know. I'm afraid I don't know his name, but I do know he's been studying the local native languages.",
"I'm looking for a gentleman you might know. I'm afraid I don't know his name, but I do know he's been studying the local native languages.",
"I'm looking for a man named ",
"Raoul Rheims",
"Raoul Rheims",
". Do you know if he's been on the island?",
"Has ",
"Ferro Cerezo",
" been in here recently?",
"I need to find ",
"Ferro Cerezo",
". Have you seen him?",
"What are they saying about the kidnapping of this local priest?",
"I'd like to know if a certain man has been here. His name is Nigel Blythe, and he looks like a complete rascal.",
"I need some work. Don't you know any rich boy on this island who is afraid to travel alone?",
"You know, now that I think of it, I don't have any business.",
"Ha-ha! It looks like he has troubled you enough if you speak of him in a such manner.",
"That's true. But you didn't answer my question. Was he here or not?",
"Yes, just a few hours before you came. He spoke with some man.\nAs I recall, they argued, but then they found some common interest.",
"Have you heard anything else? Where has he left?",
"I don't know. But the lad he was talking to is local - I've seen him before.",
"Where? Where does he live?!",
"Calm down! He lives in a house right behind my tavern. As you leave the tavern you'll see gates leading to a small yard. And the man is a fat lad in leather clothes.",
"That's the fellow I need! Thank you.",
"The whole colony's talking about it! Imagine barging into a church in broad daylight and kidnapping the Padre! And they disappeared before anyone could do anything.", // --> edited by Cat for Animists Quest fix
"Who were they? Men in masks?",
"No. From what I hear, they were just your usual cutthroats. But it's funny you should mention masks...",
"Funny? Why?",
"Not so long ago, a man showed up here in a mask.",
"Really? What did he want?",
"Why is it so important to you? I'm not sure I should be sharing his business with other customers.",
"I think he might be connected to the abduction of the priest. You want to help with that, don't you?",
"Yes, I suppose so. All right - three weeks ago, this man shows up, dressed in a mask. He was very courteous, especially by today's standards. Never said an ill word to anyone. Called himself a Stallion.",
"Stallion, hm? Go on.",
"Well, the citizens here weren't too sure about him, but he never did anything wrong - just spent a lot of time talking with the local youngsters - and that wasn't so bad. For once, they seemed less interested in getting into trouble.",
"And then?",
"And then...something happened. Now all of the young lads are preparing to leave town on some campaign with him. The cooper's son had quite a row with his father, and left home. The cooper was pretty angry about that, and went to speak with our man of mystery - but soon ran out of the man's house as if a thousand devils were after him.\nThat very night the cooper got some rot gut rum somewhere, got horribly drunk, and ended up drowned. What was he thinking, walking by the pier at night, when he could hardly walk at all?! And, you know something? His son didn't seem to care.",
"That is strange, indeed. Where can I find this lad?",
"The cooper's son? He'll be wandering around town somewhere. He's been at loose ends since the masked man disappeared.",
"I'll find him. What's his name?",
"Jordano",
"is his name. Nice-looking lad, just like his father, the poor soul. We'll miss the cooper; he was a good man.", // <-- edited by Cat for Animists Quest fix
"Thanks.",
"Of course, ",
". In fact, he's sitting at the table there.",
"Thank you.",
"Of course, ",
". He was here, but he's recently sailed to #sConceicao#.",
"Thanks.",
"Raoul Rheims",
"? The name sounds familiar, but it's been a while since I've heard it. Sorry I can't be of more help.",
"Don't worry about it. I'll just have to keep looking. Let me ask you something else.",
"Alas, I can't help you.",
"Sorry to hear that. Maybe you've seen the lady named ",
"Danielle",
"Danielle",
"?",
"Yes, I have. She dropped in here just a few minutes ago. She seemed upset, although I didn't ask why.",
"Good. Maybe I can still catch up to her.",
"It's rather late for that. You'll have better luck if you come back in the morning. Or perhaps you'd care to spend a night in the tavern.",
"Perhaps I would. You have a free room?",
"Maybe I will. But let me ask you something else first.",
"I do have a room available. How long do you plan to stay?",
"Until morning.",
"Just until nightfall.",
"Fine. It'll cost you 5 gold coins.",
"All right. Here you go.",
"In that case, I'm afraid my wallet and I will be spending a night in the common hall.",
"No thanks. If that's the price, I'll save a few coins and spend a night in the common hall.",
"Maybe later. Let me ask you about something else.",
"Fine. It'll cost you 5 gold coins.",
"All right. Here you go.",
"In that case, I'm afraid my wallet and I will be spending a night in the common hall.",
"No thanks. If that's the price, I'll save a few coins and spend a night in the common hall.",
"I'll think about it. Thanks.",
"Please! Stop this madness at once! Don't make me call for the guards!",
"All right! I'm going.",
"If there is such a person, he might prefer to avoid attracting attention with so many consorts - as I'd expect you to know.", 
"Yes, I forgot. All right, I'll come back later, when I've got fewer ships, ha-ha.",
"I don't want to help you, with all the harm you've done to my country.",
"Just look at this patriot. Well, goodbye.", 
"Your hands are covered in blood. Do you seriously think anybody will travel with you?",
"You are right. Everyone's afraid of me. How amusing.",
"You came just at the right time. One merchant here was searching for the right company to travel in. You should speak to him. Here he is, coming into the tavern.",
"I'll do that.",
"No, there is nobody I can think of at the moment. Maybe next time.",
"Hmm. Then I will wait.",
"I hear you captured a pirate. When's the hanging? I always enjoy a good hanging. Drinks all around!",
"Bah! those fools who call themselves jailers! He got away, but the soldiers will find him soon enough.", 
"Well, at least I haven't missed anything yet. Save those drinks for later, mate.",
