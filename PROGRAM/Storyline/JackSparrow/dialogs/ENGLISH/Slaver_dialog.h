"What do you want?",
"You can see this fellow is not resisting. I won't let you kill an unarmed man. Drop your sword.",
"You're doing fine. Carry on.",
"Did you see what that slave tried to do to me. He stole my weapon and tried to use it to kill me, thanks for stepping in.",
"Yeah. It was no trouble, savvy. (THINKS: I just killed a slave, I need to redeem myself somehow!)",
"Did you see how Gombo tried to kill me? The scum took my sword and started to slash me up,\n He won't be hurting his owners anymore, will he? haha\nI'm a good officer - do you have a place for me on your ship? I need to earn some money before I can return to the slave plantation.",
"Sorry. Not interested.",
"We'll see how you do in real action. (THINKS: Maybe I can free these slaves!)",
"You won't regret it! Now the only thing left to discuss out is my salary. I'm not going to work for free, you know.",
"How much do you want?",
"3000 gold, and my soul is yours.",
"Deal. Welcome to the crew.",
"Hmm. You rate yourself highly. I'll think about it.... Later.",
"Can I join your crew? I ask only 300 coins.",
"Sorry. My crew is full.",
"Sure. Here's your 300.",
"What are your orders, sir?",
"I'm listening.",
"Just having a look around.",
"Nothing.",
"Cap, it's you?! Good thing you came! I've just made us a deal that will make us rich!",
"What deal?",
"Good day, captain.",
"What? Why did you leave the ship?!",
"Well, I've got us a bet with the locals for 10000 gold that we'll manage to sink Mean Harry.",
"What are you talking about? You're at it again?!",
"What do you mean, cap? All right, the chocolate deal wasn't so sweet, but we're talking about 10000 here!",
"That's it. I'm sick of your crackpot schemes! You're fired!",
"Refuse this stupid bet. Right now. And I've had quite enough of your 'initiative' already!",
"Tell me more about this Harry.",
"It's all pretty easy, cap. We've got a month to sink the bastard. He should somewhere near here.",
"I said - tell me ABOUT HARRY!",
"Oh, come on, cap, don't make such a fuss. So, this Harry hasn't got any more than a piddling little ship...maybe a corvette or a frigate, I don't know for sure.\nAnd the local governor has offered 3000 gold for his head. We'll get another 10000 if we sink him within a month.",
"A frigate or a corvette?! Nigel, are completely out of your mind?! To hell with this bet!",
"Hmm. It's risky... but the reward is worth it. We can take this Harry.",
"I knew you'd buy that, cap! You'll see! You and I are going to do great things!",
"Dear me.... That last part of your statement is especially reassuring...",
"Oh, it's easy. We deliver this shipment of chocolate to #sIsla Muelle#, and we'll get paid a whole 2000 piasters!",
"What?! Who gave you the right to make deals in my name?",
"Relax. It's a great deal. I was a captain myself for a while, so I know how to negotiate.",
"That was your last stunt. You're fired.",
"All right, you've got half an hour to cancel the deal, and then get back to the ship. Is that CLEAR?!",
"You're lucky that I don't want to risk my reputation by canceling that deal. But if you do such a thing again, you'll be in serious trouble.",
"Relax, cap. Don't give me that look. I'll explain everything.",
"You better do that.",
"Thing is, that dirty pig whose ship I sank? He seriously screwed me over a few months ago.\nI couldn't just let him go after that, could I! I mean, the rat sold me spoiled goods!",
"Oh, God, Nigel, how many more disasters will you bring me?! That's it, you're fired!",
"Well, I think you've done the right thing.",
"We've done it, cap! That'll show em...",
"Shut up, Nigel. You're fired!",
"Yes, yes, but remember, this was your last trick! Understand? If you do it again, I'll skin you alive!",
"As you say, cap.",
"All right, get back to the ship.",
"We've got nothing to talk about.",
"...",
"You shouldn't say that, cap. I'm only looking out for our best interests...",
"Shut up! How many tons of chocolate must we haul?",
"Only 100 tons, cap.",
"Hmm. All right, we've got space for that. Now get back to the ship!",
"You're mad! Where am I going to put it, in my cabin?! You've got half an hour to cancel this deal!",
"You're a slaver? I can't stand slavers, savvy! Prepare to die!",
"Sir, this is the island we were heading for when you found me on #sisland_Aruba#. We were coming for a large bit of gold, that was one of our ships that ran aground.",
"And how do I get to this gold?",
"There is a path through a waterfall just outside the town, that leads through a cavern, to a shore where the ship is.",
"Lets go then.",
"The treasure is located in the front of the ship.",
"Thanks for telling me.",
"With this money I have enough to return to the Plantation.",
"Where is the Plantation?",
"Sail to #sisland_Eluethera# island and then make port in #sEleuthera#. The Plantation is located just outside the city.",
"Ok we shall set sail for #sisland_Eluethera# then... savvy.",
