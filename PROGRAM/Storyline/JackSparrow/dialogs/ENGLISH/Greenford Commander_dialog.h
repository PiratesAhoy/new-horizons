"You smell like a pirate to me.",
"Commander! I'm an honest hard working man",
"So do you have anything to say...? Before I have you hung, and put in a cage in the harbour for the birds to peck at.",
"There's been a terrible mistake. Sir!",
"Mistake!? Your accomplice was seen by my men boarding your ship! .",
"No, no! Sir. That gang of cut-throats were trying to rob me, when your brave men came to my rescue. My ship, er... boat, is a Tartane. It's here in the harbour.",
"What! ... Soldier! Tell me what you saw again!",
"Yes, tell him how you saw me chasing after one of them, when you scared them off as you came down the beach!",
"Ah, yes! That doesn't explain the diamonds though. Does it?",
"Oh! the Diamonds. So sad. So very sad. They are my inheritance from my dear, dear mother. I miss her so much. She will not pass this way again. [THINKS: Because she is home in England!]",
"Hmmm! So why were you carrying the diamonds with you?",
"I was going to use them to buy a better boat. Those 'robbers' said they had a ship for sale down on the beach. That's why I was there, but they tried to rob me instead, and if it hadn't been for your brave, brave soldiers, I shudder to think what might have become of me.",
"That sounds plausible, but...",
"Indeed, Commander, I am so grateful to you, and your brave men. I shall be writing a letter to the Governor himself, telling him how bravely you rescued me, without thought for your own safety. I'm sure he will be pleased to know what a good job you are doing here.",
"Oh! The Governor, you say? You know him... personally?",
"Indeed Commander. Why at this very moment, I am working on a private matter for him and his daughter.",
"Is that so? Well I mustn't keep you from such important work. The names Blacklock, by the way, Ronald Blacklock. Just in case you should wish to include it in your letter, you understand. ",
"Of course, of course... and my mothers diamonds, and my weapons?",
"What? The diamonds, weapons? Yes of course, here they are.",
"Thank you Commander. I shall bid you good day.",
"You're wasting your time. Although...if you could do me a favor...",
"What favor?",
"My son is getting married soon. I'd like him to have a proper wedding. So, if you want to talk to the prisoner, it'll cost you 5000 gold.",
"Here's your money.",
"I don't think that's going to happen. Can I offer another solution?",
"You tire me. Please leave. You won't be talking to anyone!",
"I'm sorry it's come to this, but I'm afraid you leave me no choice...",
"All right. But I'll be back.",
"What the...",
"You will escort me to the prisoner now, or I'll run you through!",
"You'll pay for this!",
"Probably, but not today. Today, you're my prisoner, and I want to talk to yours.",
"All right! You can talk to him.",
"...",
"Let me see that. Hmm... the Stallion himself, is it? All right, you can take him.",
"Good.",
"All right. But let me see the orders first.",
"Are you serious? You know I work directly for the governor, and you ask me to show you some slip of paper?!",
"I'm sorry, but I've got orders of my own. I'm to send the idol via warship to #sRedmond#, and I'm to arrest anyone who tries to take it without the proper documents. Guards!",
"Blast!",
"I'm afraid I can't give you the prisoner at the moment.",
"What do you mean you can't give him to me?",
"Tell the Governor that the prisoner... escaped last night, and we still can't find him.",
"Oh, you can be sure I'll tell him. And if I were you, I'd find that scoundrel!",
"Cutler Beckett",
"As I was trying to tell the buffoon behind the bar, I am helping Miss Brinkley here, to find her sisters. If that's any business of yours!",
"I'm carrying orders to free one of your prisoners.",
"I need to talk to a prisoner.",
"Go on, then. Talk to him.",
"Thank you.",
"I'm just passing by.",
"Well, generally we don't allow visitors...",
"But this is vital State business!",
"What business? What are you talking about?",
"You must have heard about the women kidnappings from Singapore and other strange things going on more closer to our archipelago. Well, I believe your prisoner can help me get to the bottom of it all!",
"Please - I need to talk to this man!",
"All right. It can't hurt for you to talk to him, I suppose. We hang him in the afternoon anyway.",
"Thank you.",
"You're wasting your time. Although...if you could do me a favor...",
"What favor?",
"My son is getting married soon. I'd like him to have a proper wedding. So, if you want to talk to the prisoner, it'll cost you 5000 gold.",
"Here's your money.",
"I don't think that's going to happen. Can I offer another solution?",
