"What are you staring at? Didn't expect a woman to be in charge here, did you? Well, this old woman, ",
", can show you that she still has a little gunpowder in her keg!",
"Hey, where do you get your manners, ",
"?",
"Am I right? Your name is?",
"I learned them where I was born -- in a dirty shack outside of Lisbon. They were good enough then, and I see no reason to change them.",
"Kids these days.... Fair enough -- act the sea dog if you like, but heed my advice and mind who you take that tone with!",
"Well, my name is ",
".",
"Save your advice for yourself, ",
".",
"What do you need? Did you come here to wet your whistle?",
"Tell me -- how did you become a tavern-owner?",
"I want to know something.",
"I just want to find some crewmen for my ship.",
"Didn't you say you had a vacant room?",
"Is there a free bed in your inn?",
"Sorry. I have to go.",
"Yes, indeed. His navigator was sick with malaria, so Rheims couldn't take him along.",
"Is he still on the island?",
"No, no. He recovered long ago. Then Rhino called for him. They had a long conversation, and then the navigator left.",
"Is that all you know? Where did he go?",
"Well, I did hear him say something about #sGreenford#. Said he's got a house there. Probably a lie...but maybe not. \n If you're looking for him, ask for ",
"Giraldo Figuiera",
"Giraldo Figuiera",
" on #sisland_Greenford#.",
"Thanks.",
"I do have a room...but how long are you planning to stay?",
"Until morning.",
"Just until dark.",
"Fine. It'll cost you 5 gold pieces.",
"All right. Here's your money.",
"That much? I guess my wallet and I will be sleeping under a table here in the tavern.",
"If that's the price, I'll pass. I can always sleep in the common room.",
"I'll think about it.",
"It'll cost you 5 gold pieces.",
"Okay. Here you go.",
"That much? I guess my wallet and I will be sleeping under a table here in the tavern.",
"If that's the price, I'll pass. I can always sleep in the common room.",
"Maybe later. Let's talk about something else.",
"Oh, good lord! I've told this story a hundred times!",
"I'm sure you're tired of telling everyone the story of your life. But I'm really interested. Maybe you could make an exception for me?",
"So tell it for the hundreth time! Don't pretend you're not your own favorite subject.",
"Well, aren't you a silver-tongued devil?",
"How about if you just tell me your story?",
"Don't interrupt your elders, whelp! I'm getting to it. It happened about 30 years ago...I was still a fairly young girl then. \n Spent most of my time thinking about the sound of the surf, the smell of the sea, starlit nights...boys....",
"Go on.",
"All right. I've heard enough. Let's get down to business.",
"One day, a young naval sailor came along. Turned my head, he did. \n Talked me into sailing to a fabulous country where he said anyone could get rich quick and live happily ever after.",
"Did he mean the New World?",
"Okay, I think I've got the gist of it. Let's talk business.",
"You're pretty sharp, aren't you? Yes, he meant the New World. Like I said, I was young and foolish. So I went with him.",
"But how did an ordinary sailor bring you aboard a navy ship? That's against regulations!",
"I think I can figure out the rest. Let's talk about business.",
"Yes, it was against the rules, even in those days. So he helped me stow away in the hold -- right next to the crackers, if you please!",
"And you stayed there the whole time?",
"All right. I've heard enough. Let's get down to business.",
"Well, no. I was found, of course. Turned out I wasn't such a good sailor in those days. \n Got the seasickness something awful, I did. Half an hour at sea, and I thought I was dying! I started screaming for help. \n What else could I do?",
"So what happened?",
"Okay, I think I've got the gist of it. Let's talk business.",
"My lovely sailor was executed for breaking the ship's rules, and they decided to throw me overboard to feed the sharks. \n They'd have done it, too, if a ship flying the black flag hadn't appeared on the horizon just then.",
"Out of the frying pan into the fire, huh?",
"I think I can figure out the rest. Let's talk about business.",
"That's about the size of it. They locked me in a cabin while they fought the pirates. I guess they figured they'd decide what to do with me later. \n Lucky for me, the pirates won.",
"So you fell into the pirate's hands -- and that was lucky?!",
"And the rest is history, huh? Okay. Let's get down to business.",
"Something like that, yeah. The door of my cabin was opened by a very young man. Oh, he was so handsome! \nI forgot all my fears when I saw him there in the doorway.",
"What happened next?",
"I think I can figure out the rest. Let's talk about business.",
"Well, now, wouldn't you like to know? Even an old woman has to keep some secrets for herself!",
"Sorry! I didn't mean to....",
"Is it really possible to embarrass you? Don't act like a silly girl!",
"Fair enough. Keep your secrets, and let's get down to business.",
"Ha! You didn't mean to! Look at you -- I've never seen a sailor blush before!",
"Aren't you clever? Maybe you'll make something of yourself yet -- if you don't die first.",
"Why don't you tell me what happened after you found yourself on the shore?",
"Come on. Tell me the rest of the story, ",
".",
"All right. I've heard enough. Let's get down to business.",
"All right, all right. There, on the ship, I met a man who today goes by the name of ",
"Isenbrandt Jurcksen",
"Isenbrandt Jurcksen",
". Back then, he was just a big, blue-eyed hunk of man. \nAnd I guess he liked me okay, too. He dueled the captain of the ship over me -- and wound up taking the captain's job.",
"Who is this ",
"Isenbrandt Jurcksen",
"?",
"I think I can figure out the rest. Let's talk about business.",
"You've never heard of him? How is it possible that you know nothing of the most famous pirate captain in the archipelago, commander of the dregs of society for these thirty years?",
"Okay, now I know. Tell me more about those early days.",
"Okay, I think I've got the gist of it. Let's talk business.",
"Well, we sailed together for a while -- and I came to love that kind of life. But one day, we had a stormy quarrel over nothing. I had my own money by then, so I left and equipped my own ship.",
"You became a captain of a pirate ship?",
"All right. I've heard enough. Let's get down to business.",
"Yes, damn it! I became a very good captain! All the merchants of these waters were afraid of me. Had a price on my head, but I always managed to lose my pursuers or destroy 'em.",
"So what happened next?",
"That's a great story. Let me ask you about something else.",
"I was pretty badly wounded while boarding an English corvette commanded by of a persistent fellow who had been chasing me for several months. Nearly died. After I recovered from that, I decided it was time to retire. \nSuddenly a quiet life on dry land sounded fine to me. So I opened this tavern.",
"That's some story. Thanks for telling it. Now let me ask you about something else.",
"You're a fine storyteller, old woman! You almost have me believing you. But let's get down to business now.",
"Fine. What do you want?",
"I'm looking for a man called ",
"Raoul Rheims",
"Raoul Rheims",
".",
"Can you tell me if a corvette named 'Crimson Blood' entered the bay?",
"Nothing. Let's talk about something else.",
"Ah, those crazy fellows?! Yes, they've been here, but I'd leave them alone if I were you. One rascal here quarreled with them, and they cut him down without batting an eyelash.",
"Thanks for the warning, but I have to find them.",
"Don't worry -- I can handle myself. Could you tell me where I can find them?",
"Sorry, lad, but I can't help you there. They sailed off, and I have no idea where.",
"Did they talk to anyone before they left?",
"Not that I know of. You might ask around. Maybe somebody else can help you out.",
"Thanks. I'll do that.",
"What makes you think I can help you? How should an old innkeeper know where some scoundrel is?",
"I asked around. People say the guy I'm looking for stayed here at your inn.",
"I heard a rumor that he was in port. I figured the local innkeeper would be most likely to know something about that.",
"Who cares what those gossips say? I don't know anything!",
"Why do I get the feeling you're hiding something?",
"Look...I just don't want to send a good man any more trouble than he's already got!",
"I promise I won't bring him any more trouble than he's brought on himself.",
"I'm not going to cause him trouble. I've just got important business with him.",
"Look, I told you I don't know anything. That means I don't know anything! Now get out!",
"All right, all right. You don't know anything. I'll ask someone else.",
"If you weren't surrounded by scoundrels who think you hung the moon, I'd do a little convincing with my sword...",
"What's that supposed to mean?",
"Nothing special. It's just that I've got a mission to find this man and bring him to #sRedmond#.",
"To #sRedmond#, eh? Maybe you're telling the truth after all. ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" once said he needed to get to #sRedmond#, but he'd run into some difficulties doing that. Maybe you can help him.",
"Those are my orders exactly -- to bring him to #sRedmond# alive and safe.",
"All right. Then listen. Like I said, he was sailing there himself on some important business, but someone fired a shot across his bow and forced him to change plans.",
"And where would his new plans have taken him?",
"He said something about #sisland_Conceicao#. He's got a friend there -- Desmond Ray Beltrop, head of the local smugglers.",
"Thanks for the information. You've helped me a lot.",
"Do you believe everything people say? I don't know anything. Don't bother me again!",
"All right, I guess I'll have to ask someone else.",
"Oh, we're so important, are we? And what might this business be?",
"I need to...bring him a letter from a friend.",
"All right, lad. I'll tell you where he's gone.",
"So where is it?",
"A letter, huh? Can I see it? Or are you lying?",
"I can't show it to you. It's...top secret.",
"Liar! Get out before I have the lads throw you out!",
"All right, I'll leave. But you'll regret this.",
"It's a little late for that. Come back in the morning, and this place will be full of potential crew members. Or, better yet, just stay here for the night.",
"Do you have a vacant room?",
"Maybe later. Let me ask you something else.",
"I have a room. How long do you need it?",
"Until morning.",
"Just until dark.",
"Fine. It'll cost you 5 gold pieces.",
"All right. Here's your money.",
"That much? I guess my wallet and I will be sleeping under a table here in the tavern.",
"If that's the price, I'll pass. I can always sleep in the common room.",
"I'll think about it.",
"It'll cost you 5 gold pieces.",
"Fine. Here's your money.",
"That much? I guess my wallet and I will be sleeping under a table here in the tavern.",
"If that's the price, I'll pass. I can always sleep in the common room.",
"All right. I'll think about it.",
"Stop this outrage right now, or you'll be thrown out of here!",
"Fine, fine. I was just leaving.",
"I just need to ask you some questions.",
"Why is it that everybody thinks the innkeeper always knows everything?",
"Well you might know if someone is staying at your inn, right?",
"That I might know. Otherwise, go find a library. Who is it you think is staying here?",
"Ah yes, our handsome charming drunken Frenchman. He's over there at the table by the stairs, swimming in a barrel of rum, the sot. Quite the dandy, big red hat, feather.",
"See, that wasn't so hard.",
"This should be entertaining. He's just as liable to kill you, as speak to you. Or both, ha ha!",
"Ummm....Happy to be of service.",
"I'm also looking for a man called Beckett. Have you seen or heard of him?",
"Beckett, Beckett? That dog! He wouldn't dare set foot here. A real pirate hater that one!",
"O.K. Sore subject, sorry.",
"Well bless me old boots! If it isn't our brave slayer of Excise Agents.",
"News travels fast around here, doesn't it?",
"Faster than your sword it seems. You didn't kill her, you know?",
"I... Er... What do you mean? [THINKS: I only knocked her out, but I didn't think they'd find her so soon!]",
"She was only wounded. Some of the boys brought her back here. She's now recovering upstairs.",
"Oh! Er... Can I talk to her for a moment? [THINKS: I don't want her giving me away here.]",
"Oh! No, no, no! Captain. The big man his-self has left orders she is to be kept under close guard. And NO visitors!",
"I see. Why all the precautions? She's only one person after all.",
"Because she, and the other lasses we have up there, will be bringing a handsome ransom he says.",
"Other lasses? What other lasses? Who are they then?",
"That's enough questions from you, me bucko! If you wants to know more, go talk to the big man his-self.",
"I might just do that.",
"So that's the pleasantries done with. Now, what can I do for you fine pair?",
"Do you have a room we could use till tomorrow?",
"No, me room's bin taken by a couple of nice young ladies. By order of the big man his-self. You can sleep at a table if'in you wants.",
"No, I think we'll leave it for now.",
"O.K. The table it is.",
"Welcome to me tavern. I am ",
" and yes I am a woman and in charge!",
"Well I'm Captain ",
" and this young lass is ",
"Susan Shaypen",
"Well well, Captain ",
". Who is this woman with you?",
"This young lass is ",
"... Savvy.",
