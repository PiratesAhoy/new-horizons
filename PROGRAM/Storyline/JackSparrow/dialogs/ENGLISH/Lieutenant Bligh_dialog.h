"Move along sailor.",
"I'm going... and it's Captain, by the way.",
"Just landed? Why don't you take the King's shilling and join the Navy? It'll make a man of you, lad.",
"Thank you, Lieutenant. I'll think about it... and it's Captain, by the way.",
"Captain? That tub of yours doesn't need a captain.",
"That's as may be, but she earns me more than a shilling!",
"You look kind of worried. Are you looking for someone?",
"I er... No. Er... No I'm not looking for anyone. You followed us here. I thought you were dead.",
"Not me lad. And the 'friends' you are looking for have gone. Straight out the back door they went.",
"Friends.. Er.. what friends? I don't know what you are talking about.",
"Don't pretend lad. Your Brotherhood friends. They are long gone. Over the horizon by now I shouldn't wonder, and with your map and all.",
"Oh!",
"Perhaps you should have taken the King's shilling after all. Ha! Ha!",

"Well well, Jack Sparrow!",

"Ah yes, I'm here on behalf of Cutler Beckett. I saw your ship when you were sailing into #sisland_Cuba# to engage those ships with red sails. I saw the flag change!",
"Oh and why does this matter... savvy?",
"Well you see sailing under false colours is an offence, as of course is piracy, for it you will be hung. Oh and I notice you have given the 'Wicked Wench' a paintjob.",
"Aye, and a new name. Had to wipe the East India Trading Company's smell out of it.",
"Ok then, you will now be taken to the prison while I get Cutler Beckett.",
"Great...",
