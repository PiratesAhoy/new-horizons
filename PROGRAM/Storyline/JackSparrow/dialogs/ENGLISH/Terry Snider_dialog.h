"Got a merchant here who AIN'T a cheat?",
"Can anyone on this wretched rock mend my bloody sword?",
"A fellow's got needs... if you catch my drift. Where might they be met?",

"I'm not sure I follahs ye, mistah...",
"You know -- certain needs, that a man posesses from time to time... A man long at sea, with only the company of his mates, who, pretty as some may be, don't go a long way in quenching certain fires that burn in his loins?",
"Wot's dat? Burnin' loins? Ye needs t' visit de doktah den, matey... Ain't none here, 'zactly, doh.",

"What's to be found on this desolate rock besides your village?",
"No, rather, another topic will do, shall we?",
"Aye, storied she is: a fine 'istory o' blood an' guts. But we freebootin', seafarin' folk -- calls ourselves 'Buccaneer Caribbeans', if it please ye -- take good care o' our own sort, and s'long as ye be flyin' the skull'n'bones, yer a mate of ours.",

"Quite a story indeed. I'd like to know more about the present state of things, now.",
"Nope, 't'ain' nuttin' else t' be found here... Jes' our little buncha scallywags and scoundrels. An' be keerful who ye asks about whut, if ye takes me meanin', mistah.",

"How lovely. I should like to know more, if you'll bear with me.",
"Y'din't hear this from me, matey, but... Quite a purdy mansion, dere is, jes' trew a spot o' jungle yondah. Been nigh empty dese many years, e'en full o' swag as she is, but we all be a'feared t' touch it, 'lessen the rightful ownah come back -- a right fearful one 'e is, we all knows.",
"Oh yeah?",
"You've been unexpectedly, but delightfully, helpful. Could you answer me another one, mate?",
"** shudder ** Doze black-masked devils kilt me bruddah widdout sayin' a word.",
"It was your brother they killed?",
