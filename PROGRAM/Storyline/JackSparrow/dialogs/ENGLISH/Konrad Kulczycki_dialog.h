"So much to do... So much to do...",
"You seem very busy, mate!",
"Likewise, gentlemen. It is my pleasure to make your aquaintance. I am looking forward to your assistance with our problems.",
"It seems that we should all get along well. So what is the problem, really?",
"Perhaps Lieutenant Willemoes and I should discuss the strategy of the defences of his proposed new location. If that is agreeable to you Captain ",
"Aye, Captain Konrad, sounds like a good idea.",
"Hello again, Captain ",
". Lieutenant Willemoes and I have made a decision on the Brotherhoods new location, with the agreement of his Government, in his capacity as Ambassador.",
"That is good, very good! But, how does that affect me?",
"For us to move our fleet en-mass, would attract too much attention. You Captain, given your current 'problems', will be able to provide us with a smoke screen.",
"I see. [THINKS: Why do I get the feeling that I am going to be up the sharp end here.]",
"Good, Good! Well, the plan is that you, accomanpied by captains Petros, Kell and myself, will sail for #sisland_Turks# Island. That is where Captain Damski has taken your ship. You will sail in Captain Damski's ship, she is moored here in the harbour.",
"Alright so far.",
"Excellent! When we get there, you will exchange to your original ship and sail back here to Lighthouse Bay....",
"Back Here! But that will be straight back into Beckett's clutches! I'll be volunteering to get caught!",
"No! No! Captain, you are missing the point. Before we leave here, you must make a point of resupplying your ship. Beckett's spies will see that, and of course report back to him.",
"Yes, SO?",
"And Beckett will follow our fleet. That will give the rest of the Brotherhood time to make their way to the new location unhindered, and therefore, by following us, he will not be on this island.",
"Right, then let me ask you a couple of questions. One, what happens if Beckett catches up with us and attacks? And two, why do I need to come back here?",
"Attacks us! Bah! Against our fleet! I think we would all quite enjoy that encounter. What we should do, is to get out of sight of land, then you raise the pirate flag. Just leave Beckett's ship to us, you stay out of it. As to coming back here. Barbossa hangs around Lighthouse Bay and will doubtless contact you. That will give you the opportunity to switch treasure hunts on him.",
"It still doesn't quite add up to me. How do I find the Brotherhood's new location after the treasure switch?",
"You worry too much. One of us will be shadowing you, and once the switch is complete, will join you to lead you home.",
"Shadowing me, eh? Alright, I'll do it. When do we set sail?",
"No time like the present. Whenever you are ready we can leave, and I would suggest the sooner the better. Beckett must know you have left Bridgetown by now, and will be on his way here.",
"Hey Ho! Let's get the supplies and make sail then.",
