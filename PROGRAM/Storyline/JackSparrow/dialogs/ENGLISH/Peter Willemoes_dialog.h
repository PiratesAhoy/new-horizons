"Vi har meget at lave - - We have much to do, Captain",
"Yes we do.",
"I need to make my own ship ready Captain Jack, so as not to delay the mission. I will see you at sea.",
"Yes Captain Willemoes, if you'd be so kind. [THINKS: He talks so nicely, no wonder he is a diplomat.]",
"With regard to the location, if it is suitable to yourselves, I believe I can resolve that situation. And with regard to the antagonism between the various bands of pirates I believe I might be of further assistance, if you may want it.",
"You mean you have it all battened down then? [THINKS: Why do diplomats use six words when just one would do?]",
"Not so fast Captain ",
". There is an alternative for your involvement in this adventure, which I would be pleased to explain to you.",
"Oh really? Well let's hear it then Lieutenant Willemoes. [THINKS: And this is going to take a while I imagine. Wish we had this meeting over a bottle of rum.]",
"The alternative course of your involvement is for you to concentrate on funding this endeavour by going after the treasure of Cortez yourself.",
"The Cortez treasure, eh? Go on.",
"Captain Konrad along with the others will proceed to #sisland_Turks# Island as he stated. You, however, will go back to #sisland_Guadeloupe# with captains Maximus and Philippe and rejoin Captain Drow and Captain Rackham. From there you will proceed to locate and retrieve the treasure, which will enable the Brotherhood to fulfill it's financial obligation to my Government regarding the new settlement.",
"But I don't have the complete map.",
"There lies the beauty of this plan Captain ",
". Given the additional assistance and knowledge of captains Maximus, Philippe, Drow and Rackham, it should be of little consequence for you to be able to locate the map in short order. Added that you should also be able to defend yourselves against any eventuality altogether.",
"And how do I get to #sisland_Guadeloupe#?",
"As Captain Konrad stated you will use Captain Damski's ship which you will exchange with your own when we all meet again at the new settlement.",
"Ah! The new settlement. I still don't know where that is.",
"But Captain Maximus does. He will lead you there once the treasure has been found.",
"Well, you've answered all my questions. [THINKS: And it didn't take as long as I thought.]",
