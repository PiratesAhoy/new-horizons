"Hello, sir.",
"Can I ask you a question? I'm looking for a man called Jean-Bart Lafin. By any particulair coincidence you have seen him?",
"Perhaps. Who are you?",
"I am ",
"and my friend here is Captaine Chevalle.",
"Chevalle? He's Jean-Bart's captain, isn't he?",
"So you do know this particulair bloke we have been searching!",
"Indeed, yes. I'm sorry for being so cautious. Jean-Bart arrived here a couple of days ago after spending several days in the jungle, trying to dodge the Dutch patrols. He isn't very used to being on land.",
"So where is he now? Did he manage to find a ship to take him away from here?",
"No, he didn't. There aren't many ships that sail to #sQuebradas Costillas# from here, considering that #sisland_Aruba# is only a small island with very few traffic. Jean-Bart insisted on either finding a ship to #sQuebradasCostillas# or staying here. He wouldn't accept a ship to another port. He usually resides at my house, but at the moment he's taking a stroll outside the town. It isn't prudent, considering he is being wanted by the authorities, but I couldn't stop him from going.",
"Thanks a lot for your help to us. And also a major thanks for helping Jean-Bart.",
"I don't like the government much, so I'm happy for every opportunity to help pirates and smugglers alike.",
"That is very helpful and gentile of you. Many thanks of me and my French friend here.",
