"Ah! That was a nice nap. I enjoyed that.",
"I'm pleased for you.",
"Er... Yes, very kind of you I'm sure. Sit boy, sit. LANDLORD! more of your rum if you please! Who are you by the way lad?",
"My name is Captain ",
", and I have just arrived in these islands to seek my fortune. And who are you sir?",
"Just arrived indeed? New to the islands, Eh? Mmmm.. Would you be interested in joining a noble group, with a noble cause, and getting rich in the process?",
"As I mentioned sir, I am here to make my fortune, but you still haven't told me who you are.",
"Me name is Mings, lad. Sir Christopher Mings to be precise, and I represent a group of, er..., gentlemen buccaneers, who are intent on forming a brotherhood and concluding a noble venture in this here archipelago. So, would you be interested in joining us?",
"Well, I would like to know more about it. Details, I mean. You know there are buccaneers... and then there are pirates, and I'm not sure that I know the difference. If you get my drift.",
"Not here lad, not here. Too many ears about, and this rum's like water! But I can take you to me residence and tell you all about it there.",
"Yes, that sounds quite exciting. Yes, I will join you.",
"No Sir Christopher, I think I will decline your offer for the moment.",
"Good lad, good lad. Give me a minute to leave here, then come to the room at the top of the stairs just opposite the shipyard. Better we're not seen leaving together.",
"Very well, Sir Christopher. I will join you shortly.",
"Ah! well, can't be helped I suppose. If you will excuse me. I feel the need for a doze.",
"Oh! yes of course Sir Christopher. Good Day to you. [THINKS: Or perhaps I should say good night!].",
"Ah! Jack lad. You're here.",
"CAPTAIN Jack if you don't mind Sir Christopher. [THINKS: And of course I'm here. You couldn't talk to me if I wasn't.]",
"Whatever, Captain Jack, lad. Now down to business. You'll be wanting to talk payment of course.",
"Well, yes, but shouldn't we discuss what you need me to do first? [THINKS: It could affect the amount I would need paying. I don't want to appear cheap!]",
"Good point lad, Captain Jack. So here's the plan. A group of us buccaneers is pretty upset at how some of the pirates around here are getting greedy. Taking ships for themselves and not sharing the booty. Downright unsporting, if you knows what I mean.",
"Yes, I could see that, that could be upsetting.",
"Yes lad. So we've agreed to form our own brotherhood, so's we get strength in numbers. We can fight as a group then, which makes it fairer. And we are going to set up our own headquarters where we can work from undetected. The er.. pirates all know where the other islands are.",
"So where do I come in?",
"You're new here. Nobody knows who you are, so you could carry, er.. items, through for us, and they're not likely to stop you.",
"Items? what items? Surely you mean goods?",
"Ah! lad. You're smart you are. Well there is another part to the plan.",
"[THINKS: Now how did I know that there would be.] Yes, Sir Christopher and what is that?",
"Not quite so fast Captain. We needs to be proving your worth first. There'll be a Sir Cutler Beckett in the Tavern, can't stand the man meself. He has a vendetta against pirates, but we've put it about, so as he would hear, that you are a first class captain. He will offer you a job, which you will take. It'll be a run to #sisland_Antigua#. There you'll meet a lady, Tia Dalma her name is. She'll tell you what to do when you get there.",
"What if he doesn't offer me that run? [THINKS: Tia Dalma? Now where do I know that name from?]",
"He will lad, sooner or later. He's afraid of being attacked by pirates right now, and we've also put it about that he will be attacked, so he will be looking for an escort. We will give you 2,000 in gold for stores and a crew, I know Beckett will throw some money your way, so you should be pretty well covered.",
"What do I do when I've done this Beckett's #sisland_Antigua# job?",
"Just meet me back here. Doesn't matter what Beckett tells you, just come straight back here when you've done that run, and we will talk further.",
"O.K. To the Tavern it is. I hope to see you in a week or two.",
"Ah! So you're back Captain ",
" lad, I hope you have the document with you?",
"Yes Sir Christopher. I have the compass and the map now.",
"",
"",
"",
"",
"Ah! Captain Jack lad, you're back. You were successful I trust?",
"That was a SLAVE run. Did you know that?",
"I knew you would know what to do lad. You wouldn't have got the 'items' if you hadn't, now would you?",
"Hush lad, you didn't transport any slaves did you?",
"This is beginning to sound like you're making excuses. You did get the 'items' now didn't you?",
"Well I got some sort of a compass from the Tia Dalma woman and I picked up part of an old map from the victuallar. It was meant for Cutler Beckett.",
"The Tia Dalma woman gave me an old compass, but I don't think it's working though.",
"I nearly got killed. It was very dangerous there. I was lucky to escape with my life.",
"Good lad, good lad! You've proved your worth. Now let me introduce our guest, Lieutenant Peter Willemoes, from the Royal Danish Court.",
"Just the compass? That's all you got?",
"And you'll be lucky to escape with your life from here as well. I can't be using you, nor can you be using the ship we gave you. You'll be finding a tartane in the harbour. Now begone!",
"Pleased to meet you sir.",
"That's all the woman gave me Sir Christopher.",
"Yes Sir Christopher. Good day. [THINKS: That was a bit harsh]",
"I need you to escort him to #sisland_Guadeloupe# and meet with Captain Petros who will tell you more about our mission. Our Mr. Gibbs is waiting outside and he will join your ship and go with you. Oh! and by the way, here's 5,000 in gold for your services so far.",
"Not the woman, lad. Someone is trying to smuggle something very valuable out of #sisland_Antigua# to Cutler Beckett. Get back there ask around and intecept it.",
"Thank you Sir Christopher. I'll attend to it, then #sisland_Guadeloupe# it is.", 
"Yes Sir Christopher, I will leave as soon as I have re-provisioned the ship.",
"Come here, Jack, lad. Seems we've got a spot of bother on then?",
"Er.. Yes, Sir Christopher, I'm afraid we do.",
"So, that rag-a-muffin, Beckett is poking his nose where it's not wanted, eh!?",
"You could put it that way Sir Christopher.",
"Well, it seems that fortune is smiling upon us anyway. Captain Nathan has told us where Captain Damski took your ship, which fits in nicely with a plan that Captain Konrad and Lieutenant Peter Willemoes have come up with.",
"Smiling is good! I like it! And a plan! I would expect no less from both lady fortune and you gents, anyway. So, what is this said plan?",
"I will let Konrad explain it, he's better at the strategy stuff than me. Anyway, I think I need a quick cat nap!",
"Very well.",
"Well, there you have it, Captain ",
", lad. Now you must choose. With Konrad to #sisland_Turks# for your ship, or with Philippe and Maximus to #sisland_Guadeloupe# for the treasure. Which is it going to be?",
"I shall get the treasure first. Too many people are interested in it and we may loose the chance to get it later.",
"I will go with Captain Konrad. I must have my own ship if I am to be of more use completing the other task.",
