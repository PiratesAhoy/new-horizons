"Let's move on.",
"Let me grab a bottle of rum and we be on our way.",
"Drow and Rackham will be in the Tavern, I believe.",
"Yes, I think you're right.",
"Captain, just a warning. With the ships we currently have, should Beckett and his hencemen try to follow us, we should try to outrun them. He has us out-gunned.",
"That makes sense. Let's get to sea then.",
"Would you look at that... We've found the motherload! The treasure of Cortez!",
"It does look rather splendid, doesn't it? What do we do now? [THINKS: I'll just take a few coins... for luck.]",
"We get it aboard our ships and sail for the new settlement. I... er... wha...",
"Why are you looking at me like that?",
"Er... Captain, are you feeling alright? You look a bit... odd.",
"Odd? I don't feel odd. What do you mean?",
"Jack, this is serious! And there's too much at stake here.",
"I'm telling you I feel fine...ish. ",
"Look, I know of an excellent doctor on #sisland_Cayman#. Philippe and I will go and get him. You wait here, in case it's contagious. And guard the treasure.",
"#sisland_Cayman#? Isn't that a tad far for me to wait, while you go get a doctor? Anyway, it just seems to me like a mild case of weight loss, probably missed breakfast or something, eh?",
"No time for jokes! This could be contagious and fatal. We'll hurry back with the doctor.",
"Wait a minute. If it was serious then...",
