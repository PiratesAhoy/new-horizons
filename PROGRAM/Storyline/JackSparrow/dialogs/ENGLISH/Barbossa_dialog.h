"Ah, Cap'n ",
", we haven't met. Me name's Barbossa - Captain Barbossa - and I couldn't help overhearing your interest in the escaped pirate.",
"Pleased to meet you, Captain. My interest lies in the hanging, not in the pirate himself, I assure you. [THINKS: I don't know who you are, or who you might be.]",
"Only the hanging, eh? And here I was thinking you were a member of the Brotherhood, so maybe your interest LIES indeed?",
"Brotherhood? What Brotherhood? [THINKS: This might be a trap... But then again it might not be. A sharp one, this fella. Maybe I shouldn't have had that last cup o'rum]",
"I see you are a cautious man, Captain. Very wise. Very well, I suggest you sail to one of the local shores, or perhaps a house. He is moving about a lot, and I'll leave it at that.",
"I thank you for your information and bid you farewell, for the moment.",
"What do you mean? [THINKS: He doesn't know the treasure is cursed! I think I'll play along with him for a while.]",
"Danielle",
".",
"You've arrived at last.",
"Have you located ",
"Raoul Rheims",
"?",
"One more thing, Cap'n.",
"Yes?",
"I saw two men walking around #sTortuga# recently, and from what I found out they were once cannoneers for the Royal Navy.",
"And what are these men names?",
"Pintel and Ragetti.",
"Excellent...",
"I think we should hire Pintel and Ragetti before getting the treasure, Cap'n",
"Are you in love with Pintel or something?",
"See that there table near the door? That is ",
"Raoul Rheims",
". I suggest you talks to him, afore he disappears... Now, beggin' your pardon, I has other matters needin' my attention.",
"Something tells me I wouldn't want to know what you're up to. Anyway, thanks for your help. Go on, we'll speak later.",
"I've had contact with him from time to time.",
"And where was that? Where can I find ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" and why did you decide to help us.",
"Well, to be precise, Cap'n, I believes you and me should be gettin' together with ",
"Danielle",
" in these matters. I thinks we could be workin' well together makin' a lot of money.",
"I see. But I'm still curious about Rheims, how did you find him?",
"Ah! Cap'n, ",
". We are two of a kind, I'm thinking.",
"Please. Enough with the familiarities. I don't know if you can be trusted.",
"Danielle",
" was right about you - you're far too suspicious.",
"What ",
"Danielle",
" thinks or says is her own business. But I really must know how you know the man we're looking for and why you decided to help ",
"Danielle",
", or you'll answer to me blade!",
"All right, all right, calm down. I know ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" very well - we were, so to speak, neighbours once. As for ",
"Danielle",
", I've decided to help her because she once helped me out in a very unpleasant situation. And as I said, Cap'n, we should work together",
"Convincing. I'll check that. So where did you say ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" is hiding?",
"I didn't say. You should talk with ",
"Danielle",
", first - maybe she has other plans.",
"All right, I'll speak with her.",
", I trusts you are enjoying this fair island?",
"Yes, thank-you-very-much!",
". It's time for us to join forces I'm a thinking.",
"Huh! What on earth are you talking about?",
"I'm talking about the Cortez Map, that treasure you are after. I have the part that you are missing. I will give you the map if you agree to a proposal I have.",
"Well, you have my attention. What would your proposal be, then?",
"You takes me on as yer first mate, and we sails for the treasure of Cortez and splits the plunder betweens us.",
"What do you mean?",
"Cap'n, you have a fine, fine ship. You has the bearings that will lead us straight to the Cortez treasure. I has the missing part of the map and knows the waters in them seas. So sail with me for the Cortez treasure.",
"What would be your terms?",
"Ah Cap'n, Fifty, fifty. Straight down the middle. That's me way of working. Half for you and half for me and then we goes on our ways. You can go on your way and I shall sail into the sun. Both of us free and clear, and very, very rich!",
"You make it sound very easy. I get half the Cortez treasure and then I'm free to finish my other business?",
"Life is simple Cap'n, if you thinks about it. We both gets easy gold and you gets to do what you wants after. What do you say then?",
"O.K. lets do it. We will go for the Cortez treasure first. But I am the Captain on this venture. That needs to be understood.",
"Cap'n, Cap'n. I will be happy to serve as your officer, but to make things fair you should give me the bearings to the Isla de Muerte. That way we can trust each other cos neither can work without the other, right?",
"I see what your saying. I know where we are going, and you have the part of the map I want. O.K. I will give you the bearings as soon as we board ship.",
"Excellent! Cap'n. What say you we finish the talking and get sailing. We need to head for the Isla de Muerte before the weather turns. Here is the part of the map you need. Ha! Ha! we are on our way to being rich, very rich indeed.",
"Very well. Let's board without further delay.",
"I'm thinkin' that when youse gets yerself fully equipped, with a proper compass, we could sail away after some treasure.",
"Oh! I'll come back then, then.",
". We needs to be talkin'. I'm a thinkin' that our situation has changed.",
" It's time for us to be a partin' company. I'll not be needin' your help anymore. I have your compass, and I am in need of ALL the gold. It's much better than half, and this ship will do me just fine.",
"You traitorous dog... I'll run you through where you stand.",
"Is your finger that sharp Cap'n? You seem to have left your weapons in your cabin, so you are somewhat at a disadvantage I'm a thinkin'.",
"BLAST! I should never have trusted you. You don't have a decent bone in your body!",
"Now don't be so unkind Cap'n. I am not all bad. I'll be givin' you a pistol, and one bullet, so you can hunt for food,... or... blow your brains out, ifin' you gets too lonely on the lovely island I'll be leaving you on. Maybe you can use it to signal a ship. HA! HA! HA! Meanwhile, I shall be sailing back to the Isla de Muerte for the treasure.",
"No! I think I'll keep it to put through your evil heart when we meet again you cur!",
"We won't be meeting again Cap'n, this island is way off watering points for the trading routes. You'll see ships pass, but none will land. No one will find you, so goodbye... and keep your powder dry. HA! HA! HA! Set sail for the island men, no too close, he can swim the last mile I'm thinking.",
"Enjoy life while you can dog! And be sure we WILL meet again!",
"Avast Lubber! You're in me way!",
"Eh? Certainly.",
"How the blazes did you get off that island?",
"When you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing: I'm Captain ",
"Well, I won't be making that mistake again.",
"What happened while I was unconscious?",
"Miss Swann's lover managed to free her and they succeeded in escaping, taking the medallion with them. They made it to your ship and then they and the scurvy crew set sail. But, when I have killed you, I shall give chase in the #scursed_ship#.",
"When will you understand we are immortal and you have no chance against us? We have sunk the Interceptor, captured her crew and have Miss Elizabeth as our prisoner. And your blacksmith friend is nowhere to be seen. So now we can return to Isla de Muerte and lift the curse.",
"It's not possible!",
"Not probable!",
"Really sorry, but I can't attend you right now. I have some business to attend to with Mr Turner first.",
"You don't want to be doing that?",
"No, I think I do.",
"Your funeral.",
"O.K. Why don't I want to be doing that?",
"Because the HMS Dauntless, pride of the King's Navy, is floating just offshore waiting for you.",
"Blast the lubbers!",
"But I have a solution. Order your men to row out to the Dauntless, they do what they do best. Then you will have two ships. You'll take the grandest as your flagship and name me Captain of the #scursed_ship#. You get to introduce yourself as Commodore Barbossa. Savvy? What do you think?",
"Huumm..interesting..Aggrreeed!",
"What are my men doing? They are taking too long! They should have come back from the Dauntless by now. Are you trying to deceive me?",
"Why would you think that? (you take a cursed coin)",
"What are you doing? That's enough! I'm going to kill you, traitor!",
"Ah! ... a plan indeed, but it has a flaw.",
"A flaw indeed, and what might that be?",
"Well, the girl's blood didn't lift the curse now did it? She isn't the one you want.",
"Indeed... I say again, and of course you'll be knowing whose blood it is I need.",
"I might... and then, I might not. I do know that you need the medallion first, and if you kill me, you won't be sure who it is you're after, now, will you?",
"Very clever, ",
", very clever. So be it. You shall sail with us while we give chase. To the ship men, to the ship.",
"Now we're talking.", 
"Ah! yes, ",
", talking I am, and watching too! You'll be leading the way back to the Pearl. I'll be keeping a weather eye on you all the way, so no tricks.",
"No, no tricks. We need to find the Interceptor.",
"Very well, Mr. Turner. I accept your terms and you are now bound by them. I shall release the Interceptor's crew in small boats. They are good seamen so they will make it ashore. As to Miss Swann and the dear Captain here, I know a pleasant spot where they may while away the hours. HA! HA! HA!",
"Er, Will. I wish you had been a bit more specific with your terms!",
"[Will Turner] WAIT!",
"The bearings won't help you. You won't find the island that way, you'll be needing me to lead you there. Let's just set sail and I will take you straight to it. After all we will both be on the same ship, so I won't be running off without you, now will I?",
"As you say Cap'n. What say you we finish the talking and get sailing. We need to head for the Isla de Muerte before the weather turns. Here is the part of the map you need. Ha! Ha! we are on our way to being rich, very rich indeed.",
"Is this it then? ... The famous Isla-de-Muerte? ... So, where do we dig?",
"Not yet, we've still a way to go to find the treasure.",
"What a beautiful sight Captain, it fair warms the cockles of me heart, so it does.",
"Yes it does look rather pretty doesn't it. We'd better go get the crew to start loading it.",
"Ah! we has us a problem there Captain. I think we has been shadowed by a British squadron of ships. They'll sink us for sure and all will be lost.",
"WHAT! Why didn't you say something before we sailed in?",
"I didn't want to be worrying you Cap'n. After all I wasn't sure, but, I do have a plan for gettin' us out of here.",
"It better be a good one. You got us into this mess. So! What is it?",
"We raises the Portuguese Flag before we set sail. They will not fire on that, but they may stop and search us. So if's we leave the treasure here for now, and sail to #sGrand Cayman#, being a British port, that will allay suspicion either way.",
"So, we leave the treasure for now, sail out as a Portuguese, and if we're stopped they find nothing and let us go. Then we can come back later when the squadron has gone. Right?",
"Smart as ever Cap'n. Smart as ever. Yes, and being Portuguese we can land at #sisland_Cayman# with no problem and come back in a day or two.",
"O.K. That sounds like a plan. Let's go.",
"Do you see what I see Cap'n?",
"Looks like we're here. Lets take a closer look.",
" the man who rid us of that blackhearted villan Blunden.",
"I was hoping that his demise might have been of greater significance to you personally.",
"Ha Ha! Tha sounds like you be looking for a reward me dear Cap'n.",
"I er.. well er.. not exactly. I mean, er.. not money, I was hoping that you might have part of a map.. or something.",
"Cap'n, I've no maps for sale, or to be givin' away, so I bids you fair sailing. G'day.",
"That's it?",
"Yes, Cap'n, as you puts it.. That's it. Now leave me to me musing, if'in you pleases.",
"Oh! ... Good day then.",
