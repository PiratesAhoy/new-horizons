"WAKE UP!!!",
"Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot!",
"Do you not know me, Mr. Gibbs?",
"! You should know not to wake a man when he's sleepin'. It's bad luck.",
"Fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink. The man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to a proposition from the man who did the waking.",
"Aye, that'll about do it.",
"Now, what's the nature of this venture of your'n?",
"I'm going after the #scursed_ship#.",
"What?!",
"I know where she's going to be, and I'm gonna take her.",
" it's a fools errand. You know better than me the tales of the #scursed_ship#.",
"That's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.",
"From what I hear tell of Captain Barbossa, he's not a man to suffer fools nor strike a bargain with one.",
"Well then I say it's a very good thing I'm not a fool then.",
"Prove me wrong. What makes you think Barbossa will give up his ship to you?",
"Let's just say it's a matter of leverage.",   // TALISMAN replaced - The kid going with me is the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.",
"Is he now! Leverage, says you. I think I feel a change in the wind, says I. I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be some sailors on this rock crazy as you.",
"One can only hope.",
"Take what you can!",
"Give nothin' back!",
"Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them faithful hands before the mast. Every man worth his salt and crazy to boot.",
"Humm... They seem... pretty good.",
"You know, it's frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard, sir.",
"It'll be far worse not to have her. Don't waste more time, let's go to Isla de Muerte.",
"(Mr Gibbs is sleeping)",
"Nice to meet you again, ",
"Thanks, Gibbs. How did you get the #scursed_ship#?",
"I and a few sailors succeeded in escaping Barbossa and his men aboard a boat. After that, we sailed to #sisland_Cayman# for five days. There, I met a friend that agreed to take us to Isla de Muerte in order to get back the Interceptor. But she wasn't there. However, we arrived at Isla de Muerte the same night than The Dauntless. So, we took advantage of the fight between Barbossa's crew and the marines aboard The Dauntless to capture the #scursed_ship#.",
"So, you knew I went to #sRedmond# as prisoner.",
"Indeed, I secretly met Will Turner in #sRedmond# to prepare a plan for your escape a few days ago.",
"Excellent, Mr Gibbs. Now, let's leave this island. I want to sail the #scursed_ship# like the old days.",
"Any orders Captain Jack?",
"Mr. Gibbs, go ahead to the Tavern and have a drink. You've earned it. I will come and get you when I need you.",
"Make the ship ready for #sisland_Guadeloupe#, Mr. Gibbs. We'll see you on board shortly, or you can join us again when you're ready.",
"We made it, Captain. Now, will you be wanting us to wait for you here, or to come with you?",
"Probably better if you two stay with the ship. In fact, lay her offshore in the lee of the hills. That will be the safest place.",  // TALISMAN changed
"We'll be more likely to be attacked on land. Probably better if we stick together. We can cover each others backs that way.",
"What...? The kid?", // TALISMAN added -->
"That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His ONLY child, savvy?",
"Captain! What are your orders, crew awaits to plunder, do we have a course?", // At ship after dalma DMC
"Plunder ye say... yes..of course! Mister Gibbs! We set sail to #sisland_Turks#!",
"You got what you went in for, then?",
"Mm-hmm!",
"Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more... shiny. What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure with it.",
"Shiny?",
"Aye, shiny!",
"Is that how you're all feeling, then? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?",
"And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there's something valuable. So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!",
"No! If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?",
"So - We're going after this key!",
"You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions?",
"So... Do we have a heading?",
"Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... a general... in *that* way - direction.",
"Cap'n?",
"Come on, snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Come on!",
"Settin' sail without knowing his own headin'? Somethin's got Jack vexed. Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.",
"...",
"Lift the skin up!",
"All on deck! Run! And keep running! Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us!",
"Captain! Do we have a heading?!",
"Ah! Ooh! Run! Land.",
"Which port?",
"Didn't say port. I said land. Any land!",
"Here we are Jack!, what is your plan now ?",
"Well... We might as well explore the island Mister Gibbs! There might be something useful around here. [THINKS: A key for example!] Let us keep our numbers low, This way we don't draw unwanted attention.",
"We have run into an ambush, prepare yourselves!!",
"Bugger!",
"Cap'n I feel like I need to sit down for a bit... Or take a nap here...",
"Curses! These arrows must have been poison..e..d...",
"Jack! It's so good to see you alive, I thought you would get killed by them for sure!",
"Pull yourself together Mister Gibbs! You will have plenty of time to think of my great escape, now we need to leave this island... There must be an exit here somewhere!",
"Let's put some distance between us and this island, and head out to open sea.",
"Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.",
"Uh... That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.",
"I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs!",
"I do hope you know the path Jack, this here island can be dangerous if we get lost!",
"No need to be worried master Gibbs, I have walked here before, just follow me lead.",
"What is inside? Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature? ",
"No-no-no-no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.",
"Must've run afoul of the reef..",
"And how do you intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days?",
"Uh, I feel sullied and unusual. But fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.",
"Ah... Tortuga!",
"Tortuga.",
"So do we head to the tavern Captain ?",
"Indeed Mister Gibbs, let's see who will be willing to join our *crew*",
"And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl? ?",
"You'll do. Make your mark. Next!",
"It's the crow's nest for you. Perfect! Next!",
"Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.",
"And what's your story?",
"Commodore?",
"Cap'n ?",
"Mister Gibbs! We have our heading.",
"Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh anchor, and prow that canvas!",
"Miss Swann.. former Commodore.. Welcome to the crew!",
