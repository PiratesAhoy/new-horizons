"What's the benefit for us?",
"Anamaria!?",
"You stole my boat!",
"Aïee! Actually...borrowed without permission but with every intention of bringing it back.",
"But, you didn't!",
"You'll get another one.",
"humm...",
"What say you?",
"Aye we can pool our money to pay the crew. Aye! Anchor's aweigh!",
"Captain, it seems your crew is losing the fight. Not too disappointed? Ha! Ha!",
"Against immortals. How could have been the outcome different? LOOK! Miss Swann is escaping from the ship!",
"WHAT!?",
"I don't think I have anything more to say.",
"Alright, alright, have it your way then.",
"Dear me Captain, now we can't have that can we. Come, talk to your Anamaria for a while. I'm sure we'll think of something to do!",
"That's as maybe, but I have a situation. I've got places to go, no ship and I've almost no money.",
"Dear, Dear. That won't do will it? But I do have some good news. Here's your compass, Barbossa said it didn't work after he'd got the treasure, so he sold it to the Store owner, and I picked it up cheap. Here you are, what else? ",
"I don't need anything else at the moment. Thanks for the compass though. [THINKS: Barbossa didn't work out how to use my compass, that is good news]", // TALISMAN - THINKS moved from previous line
"Me dearest? I only have a Tartane down in the port, but she's not your class at all. You'd do better to book passage to #sisland_Redmond#. I hear the Navy are selling off some very good ships cheap.",
"Oh well, thanks for the talk anyway, I'd better be going. [THINKS: A Tartane could get me to #sisland_Redmond# at least!]",
"Hello Captain. I am in need of an officer's position. Will you help me?",
"Yes, I'm always ready to help a lady. Welcome aboard.",
"No, I'm sorry I don't need any officers at the moment.",
"Thank you Captain. I don't really need a position, I was just looking for someone to share an adventure with. I would like to give you this part of a map as a sign of my sincerity. Meet me at Lighthouse Bay and I will tell you more about it.",
"Huh? Oh! O.K. [THINKS: Not another mystery woman! I need a drink!]",
"So Captain, what do you think of the treasure map I gave you? Can we make use of it?",
"Well Anamaria, it appears to show the treasure of Cortez.",
"Cortez's treasure! That's supposed to be a massive hoard! But it's on some sort of Mystical island.",
"Yes, and the good news is I have another part of the map. It seems to have been torn into four parts, and we have two of them.",
"Yes, and the good news is I have two other parts of the map. It seems to have been torn into four parts, and we have three of them.",
"I think that is too big of an adventure for me. Make me an offer and I'll tell you more about it.",
"Well I'm going to find the rest of the map. I'll give you two diamonds if you tell me where you got your part of the map from, and what else you know about the treasure.",
"Well I'm going to find the rest of the map. I'll give you a thousand gold pieces if you tell me where you got your part of the map from, and what else you know about the treasure.",
"Well I'm going to find the rest of the map. I have nothing to bargain with so I wish you all the best of fortune. Good bye.",
"Very well, we have a bargain. A drunken pirate sold me my part of the map. He said it belonged to Captain Barbossa. To find the island isn't easy, Isla de Muerte it's called, and they say you need a special compass to find it. You will also need the complete map or else the cave where the treasure is hidden can't be found.",

"Thank you Anamaria. I must be on my way now. [THINKS: I wonder if the compass is the one Tia Dalma gave me!]",
"I've heard that name before. How do I find this Captain Barbossa?",
"He's in #sFalaise de Fleur# on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#. I'll go that far with you.",
"Hmmm.. #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#. That's a French island. I will need to change my flag to get in there and meet Barbossa.",
"You'll need to do more than that. He has an arch enemy who patrols #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# constantly and keeps Barbossa from leaving. If you can kill him, and then go to meet Barbossa, you'll get a better welcome.",
"That sounds easy enough for me. Who is this arch-enemy, and where can he be found?",
"Nobody knows his name, only his ship, the Volcano. I suggest we sail to the north end of the island, away from the fort, and then sail clockwise around the island till we find the Volcano...",
"...Then sink her. Then go and see Barbossa. O.K. Let's do it.",
"Beware Captain. If you do this you will have stepped on a web, and that could bring you lots of grief.",
"What do you mean 'stepped on a web'?",
"I mean that there are many people who want the treasure of Cortez, and they have feelers out listening for anyone who makes a move towards it. By contacting Barbossa they will know what you are up to. Your very life will be at risk if you continue.",
"You forget Anamaria, I am Captain Jack Sparrow! I can outsmart, outwit, and outfight anyone, so let's make sail.",
"I see. Perhaps I should leave it alone then. I will bid you well and take my leave.",
"Captain... I don't feel good about this.",
"What do you mean?",
"The way Cabanel answered... and the abrupt way he left. One minute you're a hero.. the next minute he ignores you. That man has something on his mind, or he is sitting on the web and we stepped on it again.",
"You have a good point there. You said contacting Barbossa could raise problems. What do you suggest?",
"We don't go through the town to the beach. Resupply the ship, make repairs, if we really have to, and then sail out of here. We can access the beach from the sea.",
"That sounds like a plan, and Cabanel is still watching us. We'll do it.",
"Not so fast Captain. You will need the compass first.",
"Compass? I already have a compass.",
"Not like this one you don't. It is very special. I don't know where you will find it, but you need to get it first. I have also heard that a man called Cutler Beckett is searching for this map and compass as well. If you meet him be careful for the rumours say that he is very dangerous and not to be trusted. I will wait here in the lighthouse for your return.",
"Very well. I shall go and see what I can find. Goodbye.",
"Back again Captain, You have the compass now?",
"Yes I do. So where is this Barbossa character located then?",
"So what did he say then? Did he give you anything?",
"Nothing... absolutely nothing!",
"Then we've missed something. There must be something else he wants... I have an idea. Give me a day or two then meet me back at the lighthouse on #sisland_Oxbay#.",
"I don't know what you have in mind, but I will go along with it. I will see you at the lighthouse in two days.",
"I watched you sail in. Nice ship, but we'd better go through the formalities. Who are you sir? And whom do you represent? And who sent you here?",
"Well, slow down with the questions if you want any of them answered, dear. My name is Captain ",
" and I represent the Brotherhood, sent by Captain Petros. You, I assume, are Anamaria?",
"Good, the correct answers. Indeed, I am. So, to the matter at hand. I understand you need to know where Captain Nathan Kell is currently residing?",
"Yes, and anything else that you think might help me will be most welcome.",
"You will find him here, he is somewhere in #sGreenford#. He has a secret room somewhere. Be careful where you travel though, Cutler Beckett is also on the island and has been asking if anyone has seen you. And here is the piece of Aztec map you were sent to collect.",
"Ah! Sir Cutler, yes he would have an interest in me, wouldn't he now? Alright then, I'll be careful. In the meantime I shall go find Captain Kell, and thank you for the piece of map, dear.",
"Good. When you have finished your business with him, perhaps you would be kind enough to come back here and take me aboard your ship. This island is becoming too dangerous for me.",
"Of course, dear lady. I will see you shortly.",
"Captain Jack Sparrow, I thought I heard your voice. Why so glum? You look like you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.",
"That swine Barbossa has robbed me blind. Took my ship, my money and my map.., er, other items of value.",
"Captain, I need to speak with you.",
"What is it? I have things to do.",
"I know you have commitments, captain. Just take this, and when you get time, meet me at Lighthouse Bay. I must go now. I'm being watched.",
"What is it with the women on this island? Always got somewhere to go!",
"So Captain, do you have the piece of map and compass?",
"I like the sound of the map, but why do I need a compass? I have a compass!",
"Both are very important and it must be this compass. Ask around town and you might be led to the compass and find the map piece along the way.",
"I shall go back to town and see what I can find out, and return here when I have both the map piece and this compass.",
"Yes the bad news is I only have this one piece, I will be back when I have more pieces.",
"We only need one more piece of the map then! I got my piece off a drunk who got the map piece off a Captain Hector Barbossa. Maybe we should track him down. To find the island isn't easy, Isla de Muerte it's called, and they say you need a special compass to find it. You will also need the complete map or else the cave where the treasure is hidden can't be found.", // TALISMAN changed
"You will find him here, he is somewhere in #sGreenford#. He has a secret room somewhere. Be careful where you travel though, Cutler Beckett is also on the island and has been asking if anyone has seen you.", // TALISMAN ADDED ---->
"Ah! Sir Cutler, yes he would have an interest in me, wouldn't he now? Alright then, I'll be careful. In the meantime I shall go find Captain Kell.",
