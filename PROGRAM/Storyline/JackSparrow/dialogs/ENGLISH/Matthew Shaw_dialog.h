"Gentlemen! As much as I enjoy a good family reunion, shouldn't we get down to the business at hand?",
"What business at hand?",
"Now Captain ",
", we must be quick. We don't have much time either. The Governor will be back soon.",
"But I thought you were the governor.",
"No, I just look like him. He likes, shall we say, a tipple with his lunch and a nice nap afterwards. I slip in here and pretend to be him for an hour or so, and I'm able to pick up some snippets of information from the various visitors during that time, and pass them on to your father. That's how we were able to use the arrest ruse to get you here.",
"Very clever, but I still don't know what my father was talking about, so, thus far, to no point. What can you tell me? And who was that woman?",
"Oh! 'That woman', as you call her, is of no concern to you. What should concern you more, is that Governor Brin will shortly retire and there is a new governor on his way here from England.",
"Why should that concern me?",
"For one thing, we don't believe he will be as tolerant towards pirates as Brin is and that would bring the whole Caribbean into a state of war.",
"That's a bit dramatic, isn't it? And why should I be concerned about the fate of a bunch of pirates?",
"It is not a bunch of pirates! It is the Brotherhood and they are governed by the Brethren Court.",
"Yes, very impressive, but they are still outlaws.",
"You have much to learn ",
", much to learn.",
"It's Captain ",
", if you don't mind!",
"Very well, Captain ",
", I'll remember that, but you need to remember that the pirates in these seas do much to continue the well-being of the Caribbean.",
"I'm not much interested in pirates at the moment, thanks.",
"I shouldn't be too sure of that, Captain ",
". There are some good ones about, you know. In fact, there are some so called honourable men who are worse than the pirates, and I'm sure you will meet some of them in the Caribbean sooner or later.",
"I'll take your word for it. What else?",
"Just two things. Your father suggests you should sail to #sOxbay# on #sisland_Oxbay# and ask around. I'm not sure what you are looking for, but I'm sure you will pick up on something that will help your father and save the Brotherhood. And he left you this sword. I must go now, the governor will be back in a minute.",
"I'm not sure I'm interested in helping either of them at the moment, but I might try my luck in #sOxbay# anyway. Oh! And thanks for the sword. Goodbye.",
"Thank you sergeant, we will dispose of the prisoner from here. You may return to your post. Prisoner, present yourself to the court.",
"[THINKS: Bloody 'dispose of'... 'present' myself! What the heck is going on here?]",
"Good to see you again Captain.. I think.",
"Don't say anymore!",
