"Welcome to the house of our Lord, ", //4
" my son. I'm glad to see a sailor who doesn't neglect his soul.",
"Hello, ",
". So - are you here for confession?",
"My son, I'm glad to see you and am ready to take your confession if you would freely give it. The Lord knows that sin is unavoidable in earthly life.",
", I'd like to give a gift to the Church.",
"I need to talk to you, Father.",
"Thank you. Maybe next time.",
"I'm pleased to welcome a new sheep to our flock",
". ",
"Then please accept my gift.",
"May I talk with you, Father?",
"Thank you, Father, but I must go.",
"Is this concerning your faith, my son?",
"Maybe. I can't help but notice that you seem worried about something. Can I help you somehow?",
"This is concerning the business you entrusted me with.",
"Possibly. I can see in your face that something disturbs you. Maybe I could help.",
"I have a letter for you.",
"Inconceivable! ", //22
"Father Gareth", //23
", serving the Prince of Darkness? Who could have possibly imagined? Why, how...", //24
"Now I know who is to blame for my recent troubles. It was he who reported all my movements to the monks!", //25
"I need permission to free a prisoner being held in #sisland_Oxbay#.",
"I've managed to acquire the permission you asked for. I also suggest you take this uniform, it will help you to release him. Here they are - and please remember my faith in you.",
"Don't worry - I'll do it right.",
"No. Let's talk about something else.", //29
"There's more - my men and I have destroyed the sect.",
"No. Thing is, there's a man who'd like to donate a certain amount of gold to your church. I'm fulfilling his request.",
"Um... No. Let's change the subject, all right?", //32
"The Lord has provided us with a miracle! However I have heard how you dealt with my first request and can not have you getting away with impersonating a man of god, also it appears you still have the women with you. I think you are the kidnapper!",
"I'm so sorry but I'm afraid I have to get to Singapore to return the women and you can't stop me. (THINKS: Damn Ammand the Corsair must have told him).",
"I suppose you have called the guards, I will escape for I'm Captain Jack Sparrow",
"I don't believe it. This prisoner is one of those you've asked me to destroy.",
"But if that's so, then why free him?",
"I'll need to gain his trust. He knows where their lair is, and he'll be much more likely to tell me if he believes I'm on his side.",
"I understand. Yes, I'll see what I can do. Wait here.",
"All right.",
"They are mysterious people, servants of the devil!", //41
"As you say, Father. But they all wore the masks.",
"All the easier to gain the trust of those they wish to corrupt. We must find the lair of these devils! Captain, do you think you could travel to #sIsla Muelle# for us and ask some questions there?",
"Yes, absolutely. I'm still looking for those missing women.",
"May the good Lord be with you, my son.",
"I won't fail you.",
"Of course, my son. But wait, before you go, there's something else I need to do. I'd like to introduce someone...", //47
"Yes?",
"But we're wasting time. Do you accept my offer?", //del
"As I recall, you offered me 15000 gold pieces for the sect's demise. Correct?", //del
"Thank the Lord! I wondered if you had gotten there in time for ",
"Padre Domingues",
" to pass this letter to you.",
"Yes, although it's becoming increasingly more dangerous to work for you, Father. I was attacked and nearly killed by men in black masks who wished to take this letter from me. And I am sorry to report that cutthroats have kidnapped Padre Domingues.",
"Yes, that unfortunate news has arrived here before you. I'm afraid our worst fears have come to pass.",
"What do you mean?", //56
"Several years ago, a Satanist lair was destroyed in Italy. Unfortunately, the head of that order managed to escape, and lately there has been evidence that he settled here in this archipelago with some of his followers. Now, judging by the disappearances of women and now a ranking priest, he's active again and intends to conduct a certain ancient and profane ritual.\nThe whole of the archipelago is in danger, Captain! We must stop him!",
"I see. This is the connection to the 'Crimson Blood' and the women I have been looking for. How may I help?", //58
"We need you to serve as the swift sword of our Lord, acting out His vengeance. But as I understand you are a man of, ah... business, I offer you 15000 gold pieces for your service to the Church.",
"Well, I started all of this so as to help those poor women from Singapore. But I must admit, your offer is not bad...",
"It's a blessing from the Lord that you're here now. I do need your help.",
"I'm listening, Father.", //62
"I'm afraid your ill fame prevents me from asking for your aid in matters of the Church.",
"Frankly, that doesn't worry me too much.",
"I will help you all I can, my son. However I do need to caution you - my new task is urgent, and far more complex that it may initially sound.",
"Hm... Perhaps you'll be kind enough to give me the details?", //66
"Some women were abducted from Asia and brought to the Caribbean...",
"Incredible. That is the subject of my inquiry. Do you know anything about it?",
"Hm. We didn't know about that. I think your news might explain some things. It seems my next task for you may bring us information we all need.\nI'd like you to deliver a message to #sIsla Muelle# and hand it to a man named ",
"Padre Domingues",
"Padre Domingues",
".\nHe is a ranking priest of the Church in Spain. He'll give you further directions, if necessary, to aid you in this search.", //72
"That seems very simple. What makes it so complex?",
"And it was an unfortunate way to find out. Our accolyte was a good and decent lad, and his senseless death saddens us all.",
"Ah. So as your newly appointed courier, someone may try to kill me as well, to stop this letter from reaching its destination.",
"I'm afraid that's true. We will understand if you refuse.",
"Oh, the money's far too good to refuse, Father.", //77
"You are brave and resourceful, Captain. That will most certainly help. Here's the letter. Remember, you must give it to ",
"Padre Domingues",
", and only to him. And you'll find him on #sisland_Isla Muelle#.",
"All right. This shouldn't take long.", //81
"What did you manage to find out?",
"Father Jerald",
"Nothing yet.",
" is guilty of the crimes of which he is accused.",
"Father Jerald",
"Father Jerald",
" is innocent of the crimes of which he is accused.", //88
"Indeed! Do you have proof of that?",
"I do. These letters appear to smear the priest's reputation - but in fact they were written by his assistant.",
"What a cruel deception! I'll resolve this immediately. You've done an excellent job in the service of the Church, and I'm happy to give you this reward as our thanks.\nPlease, keep visiting me from time to time - I'm constantly in need of assistance from someone with your particular...talents.", //91
"Thank you, Father. I think I'll go, now.", //92
"Indeed! Do you have evidence of this?",
"Yes. These letters tell the whole story.",
"Oh my, I see. I was praying that it wasn't true. But you've done your job. Here is your reward, Captain.\nPlease, keep visiting me from time to time - I'm sure I'll need your services again later.", //95
"Thank you, Father. I think I'll go, now.",
"I am not sure you can, my son. You see, I need help in a serious matter, and I would prefer to find that help outside the Church.", // --Cat
"Some people would say I'm very much outside the Church, Father. But I am a ship's captain; tell me what troubles you, and perhaps I can help.", // --Cat
"I'm afraid your reputation doesn't allow me to accept your help.",
"Fair enough.", //100
"All right. I sense that I can trust you. But let me hear you swear that no one will learn of this conversation.",
"You may consider yourself in my confessional, Father.",
"Fine. Then listen: Rumors have reached me that one of my brothers in faith has forgotten his vows to the Lord and is mired in sin. Unfortunately, I can't leave my flock to check on these rumors myself, and it will only arouse suspicion if I send someone else from our brotherhood.\nBesides, only I alone can challenge him to such a conversation, and look into his soul to see if he's telling me the truth...",
"So... you're asking me to gather evidence against one of your fellow priests?", //104
"Not at all! No, I simply wish to know whether or not he is guilty of the sins he's accused of. If he's innocent, then I need to know who has blackened his reputation.",
"All right, Father. Give me his name, and I'll see what I can find out.",
"He serves the Church in #sGreenford#. His name is ",
"Father Jerald",
"Father Jerald",
". It should be easy enough to find him once you get there.",
"I'll return as soon as possible, Father.",
"May the good Lord guide you to the truth, my son. Come here and accept my blessing.",
"Rest easy, Father. I'm sure everything will be fine.",
"Very well. But it's my duty to tell you that such disregard for your faith is unwise.",
"As you say. Please accept my gift to the Holy Church.",
"I'm sorry, Father, but I have to go.",
"Of course, my son. How much do you want to give to the Holy Church?", //117
"I'm sorry, Father, but I've just realized I can't make a donation at the moment.",
"I'm afraid 100 gold pieces is all I can afford just now.",
"I should think the Lord would look kindly on 1000 gold pieces.",
"I'm doing well these days, so I'll give 5000 gold pieces.",
"It's your decision, my son. It's never too late to change - and keep in mind that all will be taken into account at the time of your death.",
"My death is still a long way off, God willing! Let's talk about something else.",
"Sorry, Father. I've got to go.",
"I thank you for your gift in the name of the Holy Church, my son.", //125
"I need to talk to you, Father.",
"I'm sorry, Father, but I must be on my way.",

"I will pray for you, my son, but I have to be sure that you are serious. Are you willing to give ",
