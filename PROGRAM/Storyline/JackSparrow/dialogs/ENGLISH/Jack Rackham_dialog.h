"My ship's ready for action.",
"Good to know Captain.",
"Who are you boy? and what do you want?",
"My name is Captain ",
", and I'm looking for Captain Petros.",
"Captain! That's a laugh! You don't look old enough to be a mid-shipman!",
"Well I assure you I am, and Sir Christopher Mings was very satisfied with my work.",
"O.K. Captain. You have our attention. Are you saying that Sir Christopher sent you here on a mission to see Captain Petros?",
"Yes Captain, I am.",
"Very well. Then he will have given you something special to give to Petros. Do you have it?",
"You mean, like a compass?",
"That'll be it. So you seem to be who you say you are. Go and refit your ship and meet us back here when you're ready to sail. Do you understand?",
"Yes Captain, I will go to the store, then I will come back and meet you here.",
"Are you ready to sail?",
"Yes, I just need to collect my Bosun. Mr. Gibbs, if you please, we need to make ready for sea.",
"Good, and you have the 'item' with you?",
"Yes I do.",
"Then sail to Anse Casse-Bois on the other side of the island. Moor your ship and make your way to Captain Petros' plantation. He has a small house there and is expecting you.",
"Thank you Captain. I shall leave at once.",
"That sounds quite exciting. I will make ready to sail.",
"Are you ready to sail then?",
"Yes, We're ready. Let's go.",
"Well I must say that was quite a trip. We'd better get on with the matter at hand though. We cannot stay here long, the King's ships will soon be upon us. Let's head for the town!",
"Oh! Yes, I understand. I suppose we should go to the Tavern to see what we can find out?",
"That would be the obvious place to start.",
"Are we ready to go?",
"Yes, I have sent the ship to sea with orders to stay out of site of land and not to engage the English ships. We can signal it back in when we return. ",
"That sounds good. Let's go then.",
"Well, well, well! Bless me old barnacles. We are honoured! Captains Maximus, Philippe and Sparrow! This must be important.",
"Ah! But of course it is...It's about the treasure of Cortez. I need to resupply my ship, so I will leave you gentlemen to get reaquainted and discuss the details. I will be back later. [THINKS: Well, Captain Jack Sparrow isn't one to miss a good ol' tavern gathering like this, is he now? Nor the rum that goes with it.]",
"That will work. There's a side room beside the main room upstairs. We'll use that. LANDLORD! Send up some rum.",
"Here are the map parts I have. Perhaps you can figure them out. I will see you all later then.",
