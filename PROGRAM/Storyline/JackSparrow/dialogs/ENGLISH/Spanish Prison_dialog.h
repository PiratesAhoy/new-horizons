"What do you want? I have a prison to run you know.",
"I'm sorry, I'll leave you be.",
"I'm sorry, sir, but I think a man who is about to be transported to a slave camp is innocent.",
"I'm afraid, Captain Jack Sparrow, we know of your disguise!",
"What? How?",
"Innocent you say? What is this man's name?",
"Yes, I do, sir. His name is Pusasn. He is an Indian man here on business.",
"Ah. That man?! And what do you want me to say? As far as I know, he deserves to be a slave...",
"You would be wrong. At least I think he is being used for the wrong form of slavery. I wish to have him as a personal slave (THINKS: Maybe I can free him this way).",
"Ah, ah, ah. Are you sure about that? I could call the ship's captain here to discuss terms?",
"If you don't mind, I will go and see him privately. No one will know of your involvement. If he gives me the man, your relationship with him and the governer will remain intact, as only my and his involvement would be known.",
"Hmmm... That is not unreasonable. Indeed, I don't risk anything in this case. You may attempt to go and persuade him to release this Pusasn to you. If your mission ends successfull, feel free to do whatever you want with him.",
"Thank you, sir.",
"We found one of my fellow friends and an officer in an alley without any clothes on. He told us the story and from it I found out who you are... pirate!",
"Well, that is no bloody good at all! But I'm afraid you should have brought more than two guards.",
"Why? You are under arrest, Sparrow!",
"Gentlemen... this will be the day that you will always remember as the day that you almost CAUGHT Captain - Jack - Sparrow!",
"Welcome to the #sHavana# prison, sir. Can I help you?",
"No. Thank you.",
