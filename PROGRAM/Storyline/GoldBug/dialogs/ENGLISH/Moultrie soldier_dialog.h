"Can't you see I'm on duty! Don't bother me.",
"All right, all right.",
"Did you want to report some crime?",
"No, of course not. I am a captain, after all...but I see you are not listening.",
"Remember - we don't allow fighting in the streets. You can defend yourself, of course, if somebody attacks you.",
"Right, I'll consider that information.",
"Such unbearable weather...and I've got to stand here in it. You may not believe me, but my only pastime is fighting the flies that try to land on my face.",
"That's most unfortunate, but I can't help you. It's your duty.",
"If you want to chat, find somebody else. I've got my duty to do, and it's not my duty to talk to you.",
"I was just wondering whether you are alive or not. You are standing here like a statue.",
"Do you think it's easy to protect our city? Not at all! It is a very important and dangerous job. I remember once...",
"Tell me some other time. I've got to go.",
"Go away, don't bother me.",
"As you say, soldier.",
"Hey! Won't you bring me a cup of rum from the tavern?",
"Perhaps. But won't they hang me for helping a soldier get drunk on duty? No, wait 'til they change the guard, and then you can drink as much as you wish.",
"Why must it be a rough-looking sailor like you trying to talk to me?! Aren't there any beautiful women in this city?",
"And you call this doing your duty? Look, you wouldn't want to miss capturing some dangerous criminal like myself, would you? Ha-ha!",
"You look pretty healthy. Don't you want to join our army? We've got lots of room in our barracks, good food, rum for free.",
"Sounds good, but I'll have to decline your offer. Army discipline doesn't agree with me.",
"This heat... I'd give anything to return to my native England.",
"Yes, it doesn't look like this weather suits you.",
"Where are you going? Get back!",
"Cool down, soldier. I've got to talk to our governor.",
"About what?",
"About one very important affair. I've got to tell the governor that French soldiers took #sOxbay#! Can I go now?",
"What news! But anyway, you'll have to wait for His Excellency until the morning! You can rent a room in the tavern.",
"How inconvenient...",
"What news! Why didn't you tell me before? Go right inside.",
"That's better!",
"What do you want?",
"You...hic...you scurvy cur! You hurt my...hic...my friend!",
"What friend? You're alone here, ",
".",
"What? He was...here a minute ago. I'll go find him. You...hic...you'll wait here if you want your beating!",
"How dare you contradict me! I'm gonna strangle you!",
"Excuse me, but I've got orders not to let anybody visit the governor.",
"Why?",
"His Excellency gave us the orders, ",
".",
"But you will have to make an exception in this case. I've got to tell the governor some very important news. Here is the letter that will explain everything.",
"Of course. You can go right inside. Alone.",
"Devils! Of course. Fellows, wait for me on the ship. I'll come right back.",
"all right, let's see.... Well, it seems you have orders from the governor to let you in.",
"So I can come in?",
"Yes. I hope you are alone? Otherwise, I must stop your friends here.",
"Don't worry, I'm alone.",
"Excuse me Sir, do you have the new password?",
"Oh yes. Raven.",
"Hmm, there's a password...?",
"Very well Sir, you may enter the Fort.",			//50
"Thank you.",
"Lieutenant G? He's inspecting the North Tower.",
"Lieutenant G? He's free today so I guess he's at home.",
"Lieutenant G? He's looking for birds from top of the East Tower.",

"No Sir, that's not the right one.",
"Blackbird.",
"Crow.",
"Swallow.",
