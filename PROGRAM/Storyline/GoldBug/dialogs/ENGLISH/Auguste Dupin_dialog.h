"Bonjour Monsieur, what can I do for you.",
"How do you do, ehh ahh nothing for the moment.",
"Mr Poe recommended you for a private investigation.",
"Oh yes he's a close friend of mine. Now please Monsieur, tell me more about the matter.",
"I have a cipher here which I, with Mister Poe's help, have solved only halfway through...",
"Cipher ehh...? What are you willing to pay Monsieur...",			//5
"Legrand. Pay - well hrmpff...",
"Maybe you can do me a favour instead, Monsieur Legrand?",
"What can that be Mister Dupin?",
"I have this Detective investigation kit you see. Very useful I must say. Somehow the six items have been spread around and I can't find the key either.",
"Alright Mister Dupin, I'll try to help you with that if you study this paper carefully.",	//10
"Ahh, you found everything I guess...",
"Oh yes no problem and I found some keys too. Here you are Mister Dupin. What about the cipher, did you manage to do any advancement?",
"Ohh bien sure, but I think you could fill in one letter yourself as a start.",
"(gulp) Yes, which one?",
"Referring, now, to the beginning of the cryptograph, we find '5' before the word 'GOOD' which assures us that the first letter is another word and that '5' is...?",
"The only two words with just one letter are 'I' and 'A' and here it's an 'A', no doubt about it!",
"Of course. Four letters beyond the word 'degrees,' we perceive the combination  ;46(;88*  . Translating the known characters, and representing the unknown by dots, as before, we read thus:  'TH.RTEE.'",
"Looks like the word 'THIRTEEN' to me. ",
"I agree! Maybe it would be easier if you continued on the squared paper!",
"Okay, I'll see what I can do.",								//20
"Monsieur Legrand, let me hear, did you find which letter '0' must be?",
"Well I... not quite sure...",
"Maybe you should try again. Don't forget to check the Questbook.",
"I'll see what I can do...",		//24
"Yes it's  'B'",	//25
"Yes it's  'C'",
"Yes it's  'F'",
"Yes it's  'J'",
"Yes it's  'K'",	
"Yes it's  'L'",	//30	
"Yes it's  'M'",	
"Yes it's  'P'",
"Yes it's  'Q'",
"Yes it's  'V'",
"Yes it's  'W'",	//35
"Yes it's  'X'",
"Yes it's  'Y'",	
"Yes it's  'Z'",
"Excellent, and what did you find out about '9' ?",
"Yes, gives the word 'MINUTES'. Now look at this sequence 'LINE.ROMTHETREETHROUHGTHESHOT",	//40
"Can't be anything than 'F' . So '1' is 'F', not so much left now...",
"No it's almost done. Look at the end of the text, 'FIFT.FEETOUT' do you see what ':' stands for?",
"Please Monsieur Legrand if you would fill the Kit up and close it.",
"Yes, I guess you're right. Now you can easily fill in the remaining letters. Just one more hint, check this place 'SE.ENTH' .",
"Alright and thank you for all your help Mister Dupin.",					//45
"Thank you very much. But now you will have to excuse me - I have clients waiting...",
"Goodbye then. I'll go and see if Mister Poe has returned yet.",
"Oh it was nothing. Here is your copy of the secret message.Ehhr... Monsieur Legrand, do you mind if I keep the Parchment you found on the shore? You see I'm very interested in these kind of things.",
"Sure, why not - you have been of great help to me. Please take it.",
