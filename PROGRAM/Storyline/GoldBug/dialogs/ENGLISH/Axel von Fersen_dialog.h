"Ahh, Mister Legrand, there you are. Have you managed to solve the puzzle yet?",
"What?? How on earth can you know anything about this? (Who is this snob?)",
"You don't recognize me. But we have met earlier...",
"(Maybe the face is familiar but...) I'm sorry I can't really...",

"Well I... not quite sure...",
"Maybe you should try again. Don't forget to check the Questbook.",

"Indeed, it occurs on several places. Now there are only two letters left. Both are use only once. Let's try '.' first.",
"You are very clever Mister Legrand. Only one letter left and now it's rather easy. '_' must be..?",
"Congratulations - all letters found! Why don't you go and see if Mister Poe has returned home.",
"Thank you and goodbye. (He still reminds me of someone...)",
