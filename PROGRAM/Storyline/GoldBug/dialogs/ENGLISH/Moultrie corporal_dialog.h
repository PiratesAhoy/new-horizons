"Yes, what can I do for you Sir?",
"Oh, nothing.",
"... but I must ask you: who are you Sir, and how did you get in?",
"My name is William Legrand, Corporal. I used the Prison Keys the Sergeant provided me with.",
"Is that so. You better give me those Keys.",
"Alright. I also got this Note from the Sergeant...",
"Let me have a look.",
"Of course.",
"Very well, a Revolver... Let me see now...",
"(Please hurry up, old man.)",
"Here, a very fine weapon, Sir.",
"Thank you.",
"And ammunition too. Where did I put those Cartridges...",
"(He's really slow that ancient Corporal.)",
"Okay, 12 Cartridges for the Revolver - that's all I've got.",
"Hmm, wish I had more shots...",
"And a Long Rope, so many things...",
"(Come on - just hand it over, will you?)",
"And this should be the last item on the list - a Long Rope.",
"(At last!)",
