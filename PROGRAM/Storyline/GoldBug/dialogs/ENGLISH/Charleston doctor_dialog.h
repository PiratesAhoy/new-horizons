"I'll examine you're health right here. Only 5 gold.",
"I.. I can't afford it.",
"I can see you're having problems with your teeth. Let me help you.",
"Not today thank you.",
"Remember - we don't allow fighting in the streets. You can defend yourself, of course, if somebody attacks you.",
"Right, I'll consider that information.",
"Such unbearable weather...and I've got to stand here in it. You may not believe me, but my only pastime is fighting the flies that try to land on my face.",
"That's most unfortunate, but I can't help you. It's your duty.",
"If you want to chat, find somebody else. I've got my duty to do, and it's not my duty to talk to you.",
"I was just wondering whether you are alive or not. You are standing here like a statue.",
"Do you think it's easy to protect our city? Not at all! It is a very important and dangerous job. I remember once...",
"Tell me some other time. I've got to go.",
"Go away, don't bother me.",

"You look pretty healthy. Don't you want to join our army? We've got lots of room in our barracks, good food, rum for free.",
"Sounds good, but I'll have to decline your offer. Army discipline doesn't agree with me.",
"This heat... I'd give anything to return to my native England.",
"Yes, it doesn't look like this weather suits you.",
"Stop there Mister. Malaria has struck this part of the town. Please move on.",
"Malaria ehh...",
