"Do you have my rent money Mr. Hornblower?",
"I should have it shortly, Mrs. Mason.",
"You'll be needing somewhere to stay Sir? ",
"Er,... Yes it seems that I do.",
"I charge less than what the Admiralty recommends, breakfast and dinner, and clean sheets once a week.",
"Oh! ... Er... Yes that sounds as if it would suit my needs.",
"You'll not find anywhere else as cheap, and my cooking's not to be sneezed at either.",
"Oh! ... Er... Yes, thank you. Where is it?",
"The name's Mason. Mrs Mason, although Mr. Mason passed some years back.... Follow me.",
"Oh! ... Er... Hornblower... Horatio Hornblower. Yes, yes of course. Er... Mrs Mason.",
"This is my daughter, Maria. I've got things to do, so I'll let you introduce yourselves.",
"Oh! ... Er... Yes thank you Mrs. Mason.",
"Oh! it's you.",
"Lieutenant Bush, Mrs Mason, the lady of the House. Mr Bush will be my guest tonight.",
"You're very free with your hospitality Mr. Hornblower, for someone whose rent is so far in arrears.",
"It'll be a shilling for the bed. I can't wash the sheets for less than that, not with soap as it is. And that just leaves Mr. Hornblower's FIFTEEN that he owes us.",
"If you spent less time day dreaming. You're just like your father, head in the clouds, and look where that got him. I'll want the balance by the end of the week. This way.",
"I'll be up presently.",
"Well, well. If it isn't the grand sea captain. Come to sneer at our misfortune.",
"Madam!",
"You're not dead then sir?",
"It would appear not, madam.",
"She wept when you were gone, sir, my Maria. I'd hate to think how much she'd weep had you not returned.",
"She wept.",
"She wept for you, sir. Though why she bothered, I don't know.",
"I'll have to make some preparations for a wedding, then. Who should I invite as your best man?",
"If it's alright with you, I'd like Lt. William Bush to do the honours.",
"The officer whom you invited to stay here? He seems nice enough. And now you'd better get some sleep, you have a busy day ahead of you! We'll see you in church tomorrow.",
"Goodnight, Mrs. Mason.",
"Well, wasn't that nice? And now, I'm worn out. Would you take us home?",
"Certainly, Mrs. Mason.",
"Now that we're family, you needn't be so formal. You can call me Ellen.",
"Very well, Ellen. And I'm Horatio.",
"Hey, you! Not you, Horatio - YOU, the person on the other side of this screen! Give a newly married couple some peace, will you? You'll see them again tomorrow.",
"...",
"Oh sir, it's you at last!",
"Mrs. Mason! Where's my wife?",
"If only you could have come home sooner, captain, to be here in time.",
"What's happened?",
"She's dead, sir! Died in childbirth, giving you a son. She so wanted to live, sir. At least until you returned.\nShe left this for you, sir. T'was on her deatbed she wrote it.",
"Where's the child?",
"Upstairs, sir. He's a strong lad, with a lusty voice when he's awake.",
"Fine boy.",
"I'll let you read Maria's letter now, sir.",
"You shouldn't be in the dark like this, sir. And I'm beginning to think you don't like my cooking as much as ship's food. You've done no more than nibble at it. This'll cheer you up. It's about the lady you brought back with you. A bonny wedding, it must have been. <Gives you a newspaper>",
"<Newspaper article: 'At noon yesterday there did take place in the chapel of #sGreenford# a wedding uniting two of England's greatest and most noble families. Lady Barbara Wellesley, sister to His Grace the Duke of Wellington, was joined in Holy Matrimony to Rear Admiral Sir Rodney Leighton, K.B., whose duties and exploits in the service of His Majesty's Navy are known far and wide in this land and in the seas beyond.'>",
"By special messenger, sir. From the Naval HQ. <Hands you a letter> I hope it's not to be the sea again, sir.",
"<You read the letter> I'll be reporting to the Naval HQ in the morning.",
"You've had so little time with the lad.",
