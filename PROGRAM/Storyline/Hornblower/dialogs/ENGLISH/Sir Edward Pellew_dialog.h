"Are you ready?",
"Yes, Captain.",
"What's going on here? ",
"Er... Mr. Simpson and I were practising our fencing, captain.",
"Harrumph! Were you indeed. You're the new Midshipman aren't you? ",
"Yes, captain. I am Midshipman ",
"I see. Well, let's see how good you are. Take command and set sail for #sCharlestown#, Mr. ",
"Aye Aye, Captain.",
"Harrumph! Well, you got us here Mr. ",
"You have returned at a most fortuitous and historic moment, ", 
"That should weaken the French a bit! A hit on her magazine sunk her. Harrumph! .. You did a fine job there ",
"Thank you Captain, but we lost a lot of good men. I was trying my best, Sir.",
"The first battle is always the worst. Captain Keene signaled his thanks to the 'Indy' for her assistance in the battle. He will have returned to Antigua to make his report.",
"Yes Captain, I saw the signal. At least we had a chance to tend to the wounded on the way here Sir.",
"Captain Keene also sent a package over by long boat, I assume to confirm his thanks. Mr. Simpson collected them, but I haven't received them yet.",
"I haven't seen him since the battle started Sir.",
"We have a received a signal that France has declared war on Britain. As luck would have it, she has one of her capital ships in our area, the Téméraire. The Justinian is charged with finding and sinking her. She is trying to join the main French fleet and we must stop her. The Indefatigable is charged with acting as vanguard to the Justinian and scout for her. We are to sail to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#. Our task is to locate the Téméraire and advise the Justinian so she can pound her down. We may provide assistance, but the main assault should be left to her.",
"I understand, Captain.",
"Whatever you do, do NOT try to board her. She far outnumbers us in manpower. We may perhaps be better engaged in taking down her masts. Battle conditions will of course prevail and influence our final course of action.",
"We shall sail to the north side of Guadeloupe. Then set a course of SSW as we pass. That heading will put us on a course for #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#. We should then be able to locate the Téméraire.",
"Yes Captain, North side of Guadeloupe, then sail SSW.",
"We need to be sure to catch early daylight at #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#. It will be a long battle, I fear, and we need to put on a good show in front of Captain Keene. Now, get me back to the ship. I need to rally the crew to be ready for action.",
"Have you not. I see the 'Renown' is here. That's good news. Get the wounded put to the various houses about so they may be tended to. We shall report to Captain Sawyer in the Academy. That is where he will have set up his shore base. He will have the latest reports and our next orders.",
"Aye, Aye, captain! I already have the wounded being taken care of so we may proceed to the Academy when you are ready.",
"Harrumph! .. Have you indeed... And where IS that Mr. Simpson? He was not wounded, was he?",
"I was told he left the ship as soon as we docked, sir. I assumed he was about your orders.",
"Blast the man! I gave no orders! He is in need of being watched, that one. Out for his own ends, no doubt. Well, we should make way to the Academy. He will have to catch up later. Follow me Mr. ",
"Come on ",
"Yes, sir. I'm just making sure I get the correct supplies.",
"Captain Sawyer! I must protest! ",
"...",
"Most certainly, Sir, I did not! Nor, may I add, that Mr. ",
"In fact, Captain Sawyer, I was going to recommend his promotion to acting Lieutenant.",
"Yes, Captain Sawyer, it did, and Keene played his part well in sending the message for Simpson to intercept.",
"Message? ... Intercept? Captains, what is going on here, I don't understand?",
"We knew Simpson was a bad sort, bullying the other midshipmen and the like. He was not the sort we want in this man's navy. So we devised a plan to have him show his hand.",
"So you got Captain Keene to send a message to see if Simpson would interfere with it?",
"Yes, and in fact Simpson forged Captain Keene's message to make it look bad for the 'Indefatigable', and of course your part in the battle.",
"But how do you know that he changed it?",
"If you remember ",
"Ah! I see. So the part about my promotion was part of the ruse as well?",
"No. That part was true. As of now you are acting third Lieutenant. The promotion will need to be confirmed of course but that will just be a matter of time. You will get your uniform as you leave. For now Hornblower, you will take charge of the wounded as they recover.",
"Aye, captain. Thank you, sir. I shall leave as soon as I have the ship ready.",
", isn't it?",
". Captain Keene gave me orders to join you and your ship. Here are my papers.",
". We shall pick up a new crew there. And you Mr. Simpson, will accompany me to my cabin. I have a few words of wisdom I wish to impart. Lieutenant Buckland. Give Mr. ",
". Despite spending so much time in your quarters being sea-sick. Now we're on dry land again, let's see if you can refit the ship. We need more gunpowder to sail these waters. Here is some gold to enable the purchase. In the meantime, I will go and check for messages and see that the new crew has boarded.",
", lead on.",
", get on with it.",
" was carrying out my express orders. The 'Justinian' was, shall we say, a little slow...",
"'s actions were anything less than highly commendable.",
", Captain Keene signaled his orders by flag as usual. And if Simpson had bothered to read that signal, he would have seen that Captain Keene thanked the 'Indy' and its crew for their efforts. Changing the written message was a big mistake. As was attacking you. But by killing him you have saved us a lot of bother.",
"So you would jump ship to avoid your duties! ",
". You leave me no option. You will be taken to jail and kept overnight. Tomorrow, you will be hung from the ship's yardarm, for desertion.",
", the course if you please.",
"After the battle we shall return here, and the 'Justinian' will repair to Antigua, to continue to confuse our enemies.",
"Yes, England, boy. A big, damp, foggy island nor-nor-east of Ushant. Think you can find it?",
"Er.. Yes, Captain of course.",
"Encouraging, very encouraging, Hornblower. There's hope for us yet! Here are the documents. Guard them well, the nation's future in the Caribbean depends upon them.",
"There is one more thing Hornblower. Harrumph! .. We shall require you to escort the Duchess of Wharfedale back to England with you.",
"But.. but.. Captain..",
"No 'buts' Hornblower. As I said, this is a matter of national importance. Keep those documents safe. When you return take the southerly route along Africa to Antigua.",
"Be grateful for small mercies, Hornblower. And even more grateful for large ones. Now, make haste in your departure. God speed.",
"Yes, Captain. I suppose this means I won't be taking my lieutenant's exam?",
"No. That part was true. As of now you are acting third Lieutenant. The promotion will need to be confirmed of course but that will just be a matter of time. You will get your uniform as you leave. You will also find Le Rêve in the harbour, she is a French prize ship. You are to take her to #sRedmond#, on #sisland_Redmond#. You will report to the head of the #sisland_Redmond# station, Admiral Sir Peter Parker, he will give you your formal lieutenant's exam. I will meet you there.",
"Sir? Does this mean we are laid up here? The war has just started, surely we should be on patrol looking for the French and Spanish?",
"Hornblower. The 'Indy' took damage that is too severe for this shipyard to undertake for repair. I shall take her to Antigua, and the navy yard there. The 'Renown' and 'Agamemnon' will accompany us. In the meantime you will remain here and keep your eyes and ears open for ship movements and report on our return.",
"Good! You will find Midshipman Hunter about the town. He has been assigned to your watch. You are dismissed, attend to your duties Hornblower.",
"Yes Sawyer, I totally agree, a damn fine job. The French will be smarting now. As to you two gentlemen. Hornblower, you are to take your new ship to #sRedmond# and report to Sir Peter Parker for your lieutenant's exam. Sergeant Sharpe you and your detachment will sail with Captain Nelson. Please remain here for further orders.",
" I will sail separately and meet you in #sRedmond#, Hornblower. Make all haste, gentlemen. Dismissed, and er, Harrumph! ... Congratulations. A damn fine job.",
". It would seem congratulations are in order! I am just making my turn to attack the French ship, when down come her colours, right before my eyes. Would you care to explain what happened here?",
"Captain, the French have blockaded #sCharlestown#. I was trying to get them to move their ships by cutting them off from the water supply. With the help of Chosen man Sharpe and his men, we were able to take the place of the French crew as they came ashore for water. We were then able to row out and take over the ship itself.",
"Indeed! Harrumph! What were you doing here in the first place? My orders were to look after the wounded, were they not? And what of the town? Casualties? Damage? Report man!",
"Yes, Captain. That's just it. When the French blockaded the town they did not attempt to land, and only fired the occasional shot towards the dock. So I knew they were waiting for the 'Indy' to return in order to attack and sink her.",
"Hmmm! Indeed! .. Indeed! .. Something is not right here. Mr. Bush! .. Kindly signal for Major Wellesley and his sister to join us here. Then make yourself ready to take the 'Indy' to sea, find the 'Agamemnon' and 'Justinian' and advise them of the situation at #sCharlestown#. You will of course keep the 'Indy' out of any hostilities.",
"Mr. Quelp! Remember your place Sir! If I should require advice on strategy from you, I will ask for it. Until such time kindly tend to your duties. Mr. Bush! You have your orders. Hornblower. Is this your soldier?",
"Tunnel? What tunnel is this ",
"? Don't tell me that mining is also one of your latent talents.",
"No Captain! It is an old smuggler's tunnel that leads from here to the town. It is faster than going through the jungle.",
"Hmmm! And how safe is this tunnel of yours?",
"I have only used it once Sir, but Hunter has used it twice, and even brought the crew through it.",
"Ah! Major. Let me introduce Lieutenant ",
". It was he who captured 'Le Rêve'. It seems the French have blockaded #sCharlestown# but I have some thoughts on that which I will explain on the way. ",
" has also found us a back way into the town, so I suggest we make all haste. Lead on ",
"Aye, aye Captain. The tunnel is just here.",
"Gentlemen! May I remind you there is a lady present, and this is not the place for her to be. Major, would you be good enough to take your sister to the Tavern. Mr. Quelp, you will escort them, and remain with them on guard.",
"We need to review the situation gentlemen. Something is not right here, not right at all. A smuggling ring in the town itself, dead bodies all over the place..",
"Given what we know at the moment my thoughts are as follows. The blockade was indeed intended for the 'Indy', but why? Surely the 'Renown' and 'Agamemnon' would make better targets? And why not invade the town?",
"Could it be revenge for us sinking the 'Téméraire', Captain?",
"No I don't think so. The blockade without landing suggests they were waiting for something the 'Indy' has.",
"Or someone Sir.",
"Now there's a thought... I think you may have the answer there ",
". I think we will find out more if you gentlemen will search this other tunnel and find the way to the Academy and the Pirate Fort. Meet me in the back room here when you have those answers.",
"! At last! What did you find out? Any truth in the stories of our smuggler friends?",
"Aye Captain and more! The French seem to be in league with the pirates Sir.",
"WHAT! Details man. Details! What exactly did you find?",
"Well Sir, we found...",
"Go on ",
", what did you find out?",
"The tunnel does indeed connect this room with the Pirate Encampment and the Academy, but more importantly, we saw that French officers are freely moving about there.",
"Hmmm.. The French wouldn't be interested in smuggling, not on such a small scale. So what do you think they would be interested in?",
"I don't know Sir. A rear guard attack on #sCharlestown#, through the tunnel?",
"Hardly that, they would not be able to move enough troops through such a small space in time. We could wipe them out at the exits, here or at the Academy with just a squad of soldiers.",
"Then I don't know Sir.",
"Think man, think! What happened when we first came through the tunnel from the beach?",
"Well, Lieutenant Quelp stopped Larr from attacking Sharpe.",
"Did he? Or did he shut Larr up? Remember Sharpe said that Larr had been disarmed before we arrived.",
"To stop him from telling us something we didn't know?",
"You're getting closer to the wind ",
". Now get the wind in your sails and think it through from there.",
"I think I've got it Captain. Lieutenant Quelp knew I had only just found the tunnel from the beach, and so I didn't know about the other tunnel to the encampment. He thought Bryan was dead so by killing Larr we would not find out about it.",
"Good man. The other tunnel is the key. Add to that the French being at the Pirate encampment and not attacking the town with their ships, what do you think they are after?",
"The 'Indy'?",
"They are not going to sink a ship from the tunnel man! Think!",
"You Sir? They are after you?",
"Close but no, not me, Wellesley. He has purchased his commission to Lieutenant Colonel of the 33rd Foot, which he will take up when he reaches the Netherlands.",
"Where he will fight the French in earnest?",
"Exactly, and given his reputation, the French would be very interested in his not reaching the Netherlands.",
"Which means they will try to kill him here.",
"Which is what we are going to stop from happening ",
"How exactly Captain?",
"We will play our Lieutenant Quelp at his own game. We shall go to the Academy where we will set things in motion. Just follow my lead ",
"! At last! What did you find out? Any truth in the stories of our smuggler friends?",
"Captain, the French are in league with the pirates. They are openly walking about in the Pirate Encampment.",
"Good Grief! And what of the Academy? Do they have a way into there too?",
"We didn't find that entrance Captain. We, er.., I, decided to come straight back here once we had seen the French.",
"Blast! We need to know if that entrance does exist, ",
". Go back and see if you can find it, then report back. We cannot plan our next move without all the information.",
", you're back, and by the look on your face you found the entrance to the Academy.",
"Yes Captain. It's all true, the Pirate Encampment, the Academy, this room. They are all linked by the tunnel.",
"So.. we need to discuss what we now know.",
"Aye Captain, it is the.. ",
"Buckland, Quelp. Good to see you gentlemen are here. With all our ships at sea, we are somewhat short of officers at the moment, and that damn beach tunnel has me worried. Don't you agree, ",
"Aye Captain.",
"Major Wellesley is going to make that house his headquarters for the moment. So, Mr. Quelp, take one of the guards here and guard the tunnel entrance in the smuggler's house. We don't want any unexpected visitors sneaking in from the beach.",
"That's settled then. Gentlemen, you know what you must do. Sharpe, you should get your men into position first I think.",
"Good. Sharpe won't take long to get organised. Mr. Buckland and I will wait for the 'Indy' and hold the fort here. Then we shall make for #sRedmond#. Good fortune Gentlemen. I will see you in #sRedmond#.",
"Get yourselves below and into some dry clothing. We will meet in my cabin in the morning after you are rested.",
"Good morning your Grace. I trust you are fully rested after your ordeal.",
"Ha Ha! Very droll, your Grace. Well, we shall make for #sisland_Redmond# immediately. You should be in #sRedmond# in a day or two. There you will get a ship for England.",
"You burdened her Grace with these?",
"They are the documents you gave me Sir. I thought they were important.",
"I know they are important man! The Admiralty has me searching half the Caribbean for them after you decided to go missing.",
"I am afraid Mr. ",
" is no longer my acting Lieutenant.",
"With immediate effect, and after a meeting where it was agreed by three captains. Three captains I should say who would not usually agree on the colour of an orange, Mr. ",
" is now Commissioned Lieutenant. Congratulations Lieutenant.",
"Thank you, Captain Pellew.",
"Good. Then we shall get underway for #sisland_Redmond#.",
"I'm afraid I and my crew must return to the Spanish prison captain. I gave my parole, and that of my men.",
"Did you indeed! Well you are responsible for your own actions, but your men may not be as punctilious as you, and I would not fault them for it. Let us see what they have to say about the matter.",
"Mr. ",
" has been very unkind to you men. He has given your parole to return to the Spanish prison. However, that parole is not binding on you.",
"You may stay here with your shipmates if you so wish. The parole is not binding on you so the matter would be concluded. What do you say?",
"Very well. So be it. We shall sail back in under a flag of truce and return you to the Dons.",
". I trust you are well rested. A matter has arisen that needs the skills of Major Wellesley and his troops, and we are to provide assistance.",
"You remember the soldiers that attacked in the house with the tunnels in #sCharlestown#?",
"The Major noted that they were crack troops from a special company. Intelligence has come to hand that they are grouping in Octopus Bay on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#.",
"Their intention is to launch an attack on #sCharlestown#. The Major believes we can surprise them by attacking them in Octopus Bay before they embark. We need to get to #sRedmond# as fast as possible to pick up his troops. We will meet in the Navy Headquarters there. Lead on Lieutenant ",
"Ah! ",
", you have arrived, good. Gentlemen, for those of you who have not met him, may I present Lieutenant ",
"Gentlemen.",
"We are here to give you your orders to engage the French troops in Octopus Bay on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#.",
"In order to thwart their attack on #sCharlestown#, Sir?",
"Yes, Mr. ",
". That is the plan at least. You Sir are to transport the troops and the 'Indy' will provide naval support, but stay well out to sea. But I should let the Major explain.",
". You will find the 'Magicienne' in the port. She is a captured Frenchman and that may offer some confusion to the enemy as they might not know of her capture yet. She is stocked and armed and the troops are embarking as we speak. Good fortune to you all. Dismissed, gentlemen.",
". I understand you had the pleasure of Captain Foster's company on the journey here?",
"Well, you will doubtless be pleased to know, that he will be one of your examining officers for your lieutenant's exam?",
"A very diplomatic answer... I have some further bad news. Mr. Kennedy had been seconded to that fateful supply ship mission.",
"You mean he is dead, Captain?",
"No, no. It seems Captain Foster wasn't the only survivor from the Spanish attack. We managed to rescue a few crewmen on our way here. They told us that Mr. Kennedy was picked up by the Spanish after the ship went down.",
"You mean Archie... Mr. Kennedy is a prisoner of the Spanish?",
"I'm afraid so. And we don't know where. But to the matter at hand. You are to report for your examination today. In fact, now. It will be held in Naval Headquarters, just over there across the street. Well.. off you go man.",
"You're soaking wet, Hornblower. Let's get you back aboard the 'Indy'.",
"In all my years at sea, I have witnessed many an act of courage, but THAT Sir, must rank amongst the most memorable... My men owe you their lives... and I owe you my ship. These events will be noted in your record.",
"Thank you, Sir... Might I enquire about my examination Sir?",
"That particular examination board may never reassemble, I fancy. Now look here, Hornblower, from what Harvey told me, you were flat aback, about to lose your spars and the Dover cliffs under your lea. One more minute and you would have been failed. Hmm, it was the warning gun that saved you was it not?",
"Yes Sir.",
"I think in the last few weeks we've seen you face and pass a much sterner examination. I think you've tasted the bitter brew that is a captain's life. I think next time sir you will be better prepared. Mr. Hornblower, it has been an honour to serve with you.",
"And with you, Sir.",
"Your plan was good. Your execution excellent. However before you slip your moorings, Mr. Hornblower. I think you'll find here a much sterner test. Their Excellencies Major General Sir Hew and Lady Dalrymple request the pleasure of Sir Edward Pellew and...",
"...Acting Lieutenant Horatio... Dinner... Government House... Dinner.",
"Bet you wish you had a new uniform now. Eh, Mr. Hornblower?",
"An excellent dinner Sir Hew.... Don't you agree, Mr. Hornblower?",
", glad to have caught you. You are to be transferred to the 'Renown' under Captain Sawyer with immediate effect. You will find Mr. Kennedy in the tavern. Collect him and report to Naval H.Q. in #sGreenford# for further orders.",
"But what about the wounded Sir?",
"They will return with me on the 'Indy' to #sRedmond#. Don't waste time man. Off you go.",
"Gentlemen. You are formally charged with mutiny in wresting the command of the 'Renown' from Captain Sawyer and by that act allowing the 'Renown' to be captured by the Spanish resulting in Captain Sawyer's death. How do you plead?",
"Not guilty, Sir. Everything I did was for the good of the men, the ship and the navy.",
"But you were not on board when the ship was captured by the Spanish prisoners. Is that correct?",
"Yes Sir, that is correct. Mr. Bush, Mr. Kennedy and I, had taken a landing party ashore to attack the fort Sir.",
"Ah! yes. An ingenious plan, Mr. Hornblower, which ended in your destroying the fort and depriving our enemies of its use.",
"And it was you, Mr. Bush and Mr. Kennedy who were instrumental in retaking the 'Renown' from the Spanish prisoners, was it not?",
"While you,... Mr. Buckland lay tied up in your bed?",
"I believe you have perjured yourself, Mr. Buckland. Mr. Kennedy, step forward if you please and tell this court who you know to have pushed Captain Sawyer into the hold.",
"Well, I'm glad that's over. We had some nasty moments in discussion on the matter, but thank goodness for Mr. Kennedy's timely intervention.",
"But Sir, Archie DIDN'T push the Captain. Nobody did! He fell.",
"We both know that, Hornblower, but the Admiralty needed a clear ending to the matter. Buckland's career is over as a sailing officer. He will be posted to a shore position now, but Buckland didn't push the Captain.",
"By why Archie? Good grief he died this morning! Why did he need to confess to something he didn't do?",
"Mr. Kennedy knew what he was doing. He knew he was about to die, and he knew if someone wasn't named for the 'crime', the suspicion would always fall on you.",
"So that's why he confessed?",
"Yes, and now that he is dead, the matter will soon be forgotten. You and I however, will never forget him. The records will show that Captain Sawyer died in battle and Mr Kennedy died of wounds received in battle, and that will conclude the matter.",
"Now, on to things more cheerful. You have been promoted to Commander and given the 'Retribution' as your ship.",
"Me Sir? But Mr. Bush was the senior officer.",
"But you showed all the initiative, Hornblower. You have been seconded to Major Wellesley, he will be here shortly. We will meet again Commander Hornblower, in the meantime I wish you a safe voyage.",
"Thank you, Sir.",
"Commander Horatio Hornblower. You have been found guilty of treason in the willful murder of Lieutenant Uriah Quelp and Sergeant Richard Sharpe. You will immediately be taken from this place and hung by the neck until dead.",
"Ah! Mr. Hornblower! Are you well Sir?",
"Admiral Pellew, Sir. Yes, very well thank you. You remember Lieutenant William Bush, We, er, served together in the 'Renown'.",
"To great effect, as I recall. [Bush - Thankyou Sir.] You joining us for cards, Mr. Bush?",
"Mr. Bush is purely a spectator this evening, but I shall be honoured, as always.",
"Then allow me to introduce an old acquaintance to the table. I think you'll find this a very stimulating contest.",
"So Mr. Hammond, given the choice, with whom would you serve? Though naturally, I can make no promises.",
"Well, if he wishes to go into battle with Mr. Hornblower, there's always the card table, but I warn you Mr. Hammond, the lieutenant is an exceptionally gifted player.",
"Well, gentlemen, this evening has been quite an education. Here's your winnings. Use them wisely. I'll see you aboard the Flagship two bells, tomorrow forenoon. Mr. Bush.",
"Ah! Hornblower. [Admiral Pellew, Sir.] How's your head man? Did you spend the night celebrating your good fortune?",
"Alas no sir. I had some debts to settle.",
"Do you recognise that twenty-four gun sloop? ['Hotspur' Sir?] Mmm! Needs a captain. A man of intelligence and ability. I was wondering if you could suggest anyone suitable. As you were. Your promotion to Commander has been confirmed. You are now Captain of the 'Hotspur'. She must be ready to sail in two days.",
"Thank you, Sir.",
"This is not idle favouritism, Hornblower. You need to be my eyes and ears... ENTER!",
"Exactly! So we, the Colonel and I, have formulated a plan to discover what our 'friends' are up to, in order that we might be ready for them.",
"Indeed Admiral. It always pays to know what one's enemies, or potential enemies, are up to.",
"Good, good! Well, gentlemen, the reason I have brought you here, Hornblower, is for a special mission. A special mission that must be held in the utmost secrecy.",
"Sir?",
"The Colonel has an agent in place in enemy territory who has been watching events very carefully. We need to get his latest information.",
"How does that affect me, Sir?",
"What we require you to do, Hornblower, is to rendezvous with the agent, a Major Hogan, who will provide you with the most recent intelligence which you will bring back here.",
"But how will I find him, Sir? And how will I know him?",
"Good. That's settled then. I have assigned Midshipman Hammond to your ship as he seemed so anxious to serve with you. You may, in this instance, select your own first lieutenant, Lieutenant Chadd will be your second. You will need a crew. I understand there are a lot of good men looking for positions in the tavern. Also, Lieutenant Quelp and the 'Resource' will join you as escort to Cayman.", 
"Yes Admiral. I understand.",
"And remember. Do nothing to provoke war, before war is declared. Your mission is vital for England.",
"Ah! Colonel Wellesley! Excellent timing. I was just about to explain our plan to continue to thwart the French to Captain Hornblower.",
"Ah! Hornblower. I have read your and Major Hogan's reports. Now, please give me your analysis of the situation.",
"Admiral Pellew, sir. I believe the French are about to launch a major invasion on one of our islands.",
"That, Captain, is obvious, but which island? THAT is the question. If we mass our troops and ships to defend one island, and it is not the one the French invade... I need say no more.",
"Please continue Captain Hornblower. I would be most interested to hear your resolution to this dilemma.",
"Admiral. We do not know which island the French intend to attack, so we should position our ships at sea, so we can follow and attack the French ships when we see which way they are heading... ",
"There is no time to organise a blockade. War against France has resumed and we must act quickly. A preemptive strike on the French fleet. Without ships, the troops the French have will become ineffective, as they will have no ships to transport them.",
"Their ships are moored in the main harbour, sir, but they are protected by a signal tower with a semaphore, which signals any ship movements, and of course, there is the main fort.",
"Ah yes! The fort. Hogan has provided details of that. It seems there is quite a battery up there. But to stop the French ships from leaving the harbour is my primary objective. I shall take the fleet into the main harbour and destroy the French fleet.",
"You will have to do something about the semaphore and the battery first, sir. May I volunteer the 'Hotspur'...",
"Insist Captain Hammond? No sir, it is I who insist, that you listen to the plan. Captain Hornblower will indeed attack the semaphore with a small party and signal his success with a blue rocket.",
"Might I suggest that I launch the attack at dusk making the most of the evening mist? [Good]",
"Then as dawn breaks, Captain Hammond, you will lead a party of marines and storm the battery and indicate that it is taken by two red rockets. [It will be an honour, sir.]",
"Good. That concludes our business for the moment. Captain Hammond, you may return to your ship. Hornblower a word, if you please.",
"Yes Admiral.",
"Major Hogan reports that he feels our plans are being given to the French. That suggests one of our officers is a spy. I find that hard to believe.",
"Nevertheless I feel we must doubt someone, sir. Indeed, if we have agents familiar with our enemies' plans, it seems reasonable to assume that the enemy has too.",
"Hmm! I'll make some discreet enquiries. In the meantime you sail on the morning tide, first of the ebb.",
"Aye aye, sir.",
"Sir, I could send a party ashore to look for him.",
"No Mr. Bush. Hornblower may have destroyed their communications, but Captain Hammond still has to cripple their defences by taking the battery, and NOTHING must interfere with his mission.",
"But sir, it need only be a small party. We could even create a diversion. Sir I owe it to him. We owe it to him.",
"Dammit Bush! Do you think I don't know that? Hornblower may be lost, but the war goes on. You will take command of the 'Hotspur' and stand by ready to support the action.",
"Aye aye, sir.",
"You say in your report that Captain Hammond blamed himself for the failure of his assault on the battery. [Yes sir] And, despite your entreaties, he insisted on dying with honour.",
"You do know I've spoken with Mr. Bush?",
"I imagined you would have, sir.",
"There was a time, Hornblower, when you would have needed some convincing about the merits of any economy with the truth.",
"Yes, Sir. But these are uncertain times.",
"Hmm... And the truth about Hammond could spread disaffection. Hmm.. England has a right to demand loyalty.", 
"Yes sir, although.. [heh?] It is perhaps better to earn loyalty, than to demand it.",
"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, then I became a man and put away childish things. You know Hornblower.. erm.. It's very hard for a father to see his children grow up.",
"I'm not sure I understand you sir?",
"I dare say, you will.", 
"Good to see you again, Hornblower.",
"Once again, congratulations are in order.",
"Sir? How did you know? Maria and I have only just got married.",
"Married? You have been busy, haven't you? Then double congratulations are in order because that's not what I meant.",
"May I ask your intentions for me then, Sir?",
"You're getting another ship. The frigate 'Atropos'. Your orders are to engage the enemy wherever he may be found. If you can't find him, one of our governors will probably have work for you, or there are always ships at Antigua needing an escort. Do you understand your orders?",
"Good. Now, according to your report, Midshipman Wolfe was a traitor and escaped the fight at Anse Casse-Bois.",
"Very well. It's just possible that Major Hogan may be able to help you find Wolfe. Or Sharpe's Portuguese associate Teresa Moreno may know something, if you can find her. But that's not an order, it's unofficial. I'm sure you'll find some way to make yourself useful to King and country, Hornblower.",
"I'm told you have news for me.",
"Well, out with it man!",
"Sir, I believe I've dealt with the traitors who caused us such concern.",
"Harrumph! Have you indeed? Hammond shot himself, as I recall, and Wolfe escaped.",
"Wolfe stole a French ship, sir. We tracked him down at #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# and captured him. He was most helpful when faced with the prospect of a noose.",
"And then?",
"He led us to #sisland_Hispaniola# where he was to meet Lt. Quelp.",
"Quelp? We suspected him but could never prove anything. Go on, please.",
"He was plotting to take a company of Voltigeurs to attack #sEleuthera#. They were to be disguised in British uniforms. America would then believe that we had launched a sneak attack and declare war on us.",
"And presumably you spoiled their plan?",
"Yes, sir. Quelp himself shot Wolfe after learning that Wolfe had betrayed him. I killed Quelp, while Lieutenant Sharpe and his Chosen Men were invaluable in defeating the Voltigeurs.",
"You are to be commended on a job well done, Commander. And I shall write to Lieutenant Sharpe's commanding officer expressing my thanks for his assistance. We shall also need to tell the Americans. Have you any proof we can give them?",
"Yes sir. The commander of the Voltigeurs is my prisoner. I shall have him transferred to your custody, then you can present him to the Americans.",
"Excellent work, Hornblower. This will add well to your record. But the war still goes on and I imagine you will soon have further exploits to report. May fortune continue to smile on you, Hornblower.",
