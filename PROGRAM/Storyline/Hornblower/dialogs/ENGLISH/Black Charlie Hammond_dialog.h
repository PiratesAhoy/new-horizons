"Ah! ... Hornblower.",
"Captain Hammond.",
"Well sir? Report yourself we've no time to waste.",
"H.. H.. Hornblower sir. H.. Horatio Hornblower, midshipman. I mean Acting Lieutenant, Indefatigable.",
"Certificates please.",
"By now you are dismasted... Dismasted sir... Cliffs of Dover under your lea... You're in very serious trouble Mr.... Hornblower.",
"You were on deck when Captain Sawyer was pushed into the hold, were you not?",
"Yes Sir, I was on deck, but he wasn't pushed Sir, he fell.",
"Indeed Lieutenant? But we only have your word for that don't we?",
"I can only repeat Sir, he wasn't pushed he fell.",
".",
"Commander Hornblower. Your ship is to be decommissioned forthwith. She will be taken to #sOxbay# and worked on there. You will be on half pay until such time as your services are required again. And of course, without a ship to captain, you will revert to the rank of lieutenant.",
"Yes Captain, I understand, but where do I billet now?",
"Good Grief Man! Do you expect the navy to pamper you? You must go into town and find yourself lodgings somewhere. Good day Sir.",
"Oh! ...",
"Sure the country cannot continue to keep a wartime navy. Otherwise we'll be paying this damned income tax every year.",
"Oh! Yes. Good day to you Captain.",
"?",
"Ah! ... Hornblower.",
"Good evening Captain Hammond.",
"Gentlemen. My nephew, Jack Hammond. Well step up lad. Step up. On his first visit to the fleshpots. Hoping to be posted to a ship.",
"...",
"What are you implying Sir?",
"I consider that an offensive remark Sir.",
"Would you care to withdraw your statement... WITH an apology?",
"Very well.. We will continue this further.",
"By God Sir! I will not stand for this. I shall have recompense in a duel at first light.",
"I shall send a friend to wait on you!",
"So despite all Hornblower's heroics, we have no idea what the French plans are.",
"Admiral Pellew, sir. I believe there is a way in which that problem can be overcome.",
"God save us from young men here for glory.... Sir, I must insist that you send a more experienced officer.",
"You'll include my nephew in your shore party, no doubt? I trust you'll allow him to temper his steel in the fires of combat.",
"Oh! I shall certainly consider him, sir.",
"...",
"Captain Hammond. Surrender your sword and tell your men to lay down their weapons, or would you rather see them all slaughtered?",
"We are outnumbered men. Lay down your arms.",
"Take them off to the prison, lieutenant.",
"Good to see you again Wolfe. That was easy, no troops to worry about now. Do you have Hornblower?",
"All safely locked up. Now, let's send off the signal flares and watch Pellew and the fleet sail into their destruction.",
"NO BARGAINS Hornblower!",
"Captain Hammond!",
"And you thought your enemy was a junior rank! What a fool you are Hornblower.",
"And what a traitor you are, sir.",
"Enough of this. Wolfe! These men were caught trying to escape. Deal with them.",
"Oh No! Jack Lad.... not you.",
"He is dead, sir. He died fighting for his country.",
"I wanted him to be locked up in prison with you, Hornblower. Safely out of the way.",
"And he wanted to prove himself to be a brave officer. Which he did.",
"Oh God! What have I done.",
"You have betrayed your country, your comrades and even caused the death of your nephew. You aren't much of a man, are you?",
"Stop sir.... Captain Hammond! Don't make me shoot you, Sir!",
