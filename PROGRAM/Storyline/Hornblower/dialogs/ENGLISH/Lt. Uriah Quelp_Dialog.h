"Mr. Hornblower.",
"Mr. Quelp.",
"Captain! The 'Indy' should attack the French at #sCharlestown#. We have the element of surprise now and could sink them easily.",
"?",
"Did you see that? He had a knife and was going to stab the soldier. I caught him just in time.",
"It all happened too quickly for me to see anything.",
"Aye Aye Captain. I will tidy up the back room while I am there, to make it more comfortable for the major.",
"...",
"Who are you Midshipman? And what is your business here.", 
"Sir, I am Midshipman ",
", and I have orders to accompany two officers to board the Indefatigable.",
"Well Mr. ",
", I am to take up the post of second lieutenant on the Indefatigable, so I am one of your officers, although I would have expected a fellow officer to greet me, not a midshipman.",
"Lieutenant Buckland is currently our first lieutenant and presently acting captain for this mission, so his duties aboard prevented him attending to you personally. Sir.",
"Obviously I shall need to take the matter up with Captain Pellew. It is not something for me to discuss with a midshipman.",
"Obviously, Lieutenant.",
"Gentlemen, am I glad to see you. I have been a prisoner here for months and with the slave army laying siege to the fort, food has been very scarce.",
"How did you come to be here Lieutenant? The last time I saw you was in #sCharlestown#.",
"When I went to the smuggler's house to get ready for Captain Wellesley the French jumped me and took me prisoner. Later they wanted one of their own officers released by the Spanish, so they exchanged me for their officer and I was sent here.", 
"I see. Very unfortunate Lieutenant.",
"We have the ship now, and I have released our officers and crew from the brig where they were being held. Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Bush are wounded as are a lot of the crew.... and Captain Sawyer and Wellard are dead.", 
"DEAD?",
"Shot by the Spanish I'm afraid, but it does look like they put up a fight together.",
"And what of Mr. Buckland?",
"Ah! He was I'm afraid, somewhat tied up during the battle.",
"Tied up?",
"It seems he went for a nap on returning from the beach, and when the Spanish took the ship they surprised him and tied him to his bed.",
"Oh dear! That won't look good in the reports.",
"I think that's him coming now.",
"Ah yes.",
"Our Acting Captain is not in the best of humour, it seems.",
"Hardly surprising. When he has to report on today's events he is not going to fare well with their Lordships.",
" It seems you are now the senior lieutenant. What are your orders Sir?",
"We need to bury the bodies Mr. Quelp. Perhaps you would organise a burial party and we can go ashore and take care of matters.",
"Aye aye, Lieutenant.",
"Thank you Mr. Quelp.",
"The burials are complete Lieutenant. I suppose Mr. Buckland will make sail for #sRedmond# now.", 
"Yes Mr. Quelp, these matters must be reported, although I am not looking forward to the reception we will receive when we get there.",
"It seems your fame has spread Commander.",
"What do you mean Lieutenant?",
"I got to this one before he died. They knew about you, and Sharpe and his riflemen, from an English Midshipman it seems.",
"Midshipman? Which midshipman?",
"Regrettably, he passed away, before he could relate that information.",
"And I am starting to get an uneasy feeling just standing here. We should move on. We've two bodies to deal with now.",
"Yes, I think we must do something. Sergeant Sharpe, perhaps the rifleman could bury the bodies. We should get back to finding the French.",
"The way to the beach is over here. That is where the French would have disembarked and made their march inland from.",
"Very well. Lead the way Lieutenant, and get ready,... this could be a tough fight.",
"Nothing! No ship, no troops, no equipment. Although they have been here, and a lot of them, but where are they now?",
"We're missing something. I think it's time we talked this out, before we do anything else. Question one... how did we end up on this beach, and why?",
"That's actually two questions, but to answer you, we came here because we were chasing the French and thought they would be here.",
"Not strictly true.... We expected to meet the French in the last valley, because we were expecting a counter attack, and we were going to try to stop it. We weren't planning on coming to the beach.",
"That is because the valley is shaped like a capital letter 'Y'. We are at the bottom of the Y and the town is on the top left. Which means the French were hiding on the top right in the valley past the mine.",
"So they lured us down here so they could double back behind us and attack the fort again?",
"Exactly! The dying Frenchman said they were afraid of you and Sharpe's riflemen. With both of you out of the way they will have an easier job attacking the town, and once the outskirts were overrun they would have easy access to the town and port. Remember the guns in the fort point seaward, so would be of no use in the town's defence.",
"That explains why they ran so quickly when we started shooting at them, to lure us here. But Sharpe's men are still in the valley.",
"No they're not, they're here.",
"But the French must have known we would return when we didn't find them here?",
"Not if the French assumed we would think they had boarded their ship and sailed off. We would be celebrating our repelling the attack and would be in no hurry to return then, would we?",
"Except we would know if that were the case, we would still see their ship sailing away.",
"As you said earlier, we all make mistakes, and I think that is the one the French made. They would also assume we would be grieving over the loss of the two riflemen. Another reason we wouldn't hurry back.",
"Thinking about it, that would actually make sense.",
"Because this valley is shaped like a capital letter 'Y'. The beach is at the bottom of the Y and the town is on the top left. Which means the French could well be hiding on the top right of the Y, in the valley past the mine.",
"Then we need to get back, and quickly! But bear in mind the French are sure to be half expecting us even if they think we fell for their ruse.",
"What's the problem Mr. Hornblower?",
"Sharpe thinks the bodies were deliberately laid as they were in order to lead us to the beach. Sharpe thinks that is a ruse.",
"That's not important at the moment. Sharpe and I have things we need to discuss with you.",
"Indeed? And what might these 'things' be, pray tell?",
"How did you escape from the Spanish on board the Renown? And why weren't you surprised to see the bodies of Higgins and Cooper? We both ran to the scene... you walked.",
"You two are too clever for your own good. Yes! I'm working for the French! I always have been. It's time the arrogant British were brought down a peg or two and France resumes its rightful place in the world, with a decent government of the people, not kings and lords and ladies.",
"Quelp, that makes you a traitor and it is my duty to arrest you as such. Lieutenant Quelp, consider yourself under arrest for treason. Surrender your sword if you please.",
"I don't think I want to do that you jumped up little midshipman. And as for you Sharpe!",
"Ah! So if we were on the beach, the French could double back behind us and counter attack the town with us out of the way.",
"So that's why they ran so quickly when we attacked them. To draw us away from the town.",
"It is indeed a pleasure to be sailing with you Commander, and before we start, may I say something?",
"Indeed you may.",
"I regret to say that I believe there is a traitor in our midst, and worse than that that, I believe him to be actually in the Navy!",
"Go on.",
"There have been several instances of powder being tampered with for instance, and as you know our powder is always kept under guard. So the only way it can be got at, is by someone in the navy.",
"Ah yes! And that would also mean it would have to be an officer.",
"Well, boatswain, midshipman or lieutenant. Higher ranks rarely get involved in matters of stores, and if they do their presence is always remembered. So the lower ranks are where my suspicions lay at the moment.",
"I see and why are you telling us this, and not reporting it to higher authority?",
"Do not misunderstand me Commander. I have already reported it, and I have been given the brief to track down the traitor. It means therefore, that I will be doing what might appear to be strange things from time to time, and I wanted you to be forewarned.",
"I understand Lieutenant. We too have similar issues we are pursuing, so thank you for clearing things up. We should sail for #sisland_Antigua# as soon as possible. Perhaps you would be good enough to board the ship now. We will meet you in the port.",
"I'm glad you're here. I tracked down the traitor. He's behind the lighthouse with his 'friends'. I've been hiding in the woods back there because I couldn't take them on, on my own.",
"Who is it then?",
"One of the midshipman you sailed with.",
"But they are all dead!",
"Think for a moment. When they died, did you actually see their bodies?",
"Yes, Clayton on the Beach. Archie Kennedy in the military hospital. Wellard on the Renown, and you saw him too. Hunter drowned in the bay at the Spanish prison.",
"So,... You didn't see Hunter's body then did you?",
"I saw him dive overboard near the Spanish ship. He came back to the boat once, then went under and he never resurfaced.",
"Which means he could have, and probably did, come up to the boat for a last breath, then swam underwater to the wreck or the rocks and hung on there till you were gone.",
"That's possible I suppose. But how do you know him, and how did his friends get here?",
"If you remember he was at #sCharlestown# when you brought me back from #sOxbay#. As to his friends, they would have slipped ashore in a small boat during the night. There will be a large French ship out to sea somewhere.",
"Ah! So he was. What are we going to do?",
"Now you are all here, we can take them on and arrest him and get the truth out of him.",
"Let's get on with it then.",
"It must have been Hunter who killed them. He either saw you or me and decided to make a quick exit, making sure these men couldn't talk. I suppose I will have to continue looking for him. There's nothing I can do here.",
"As you see fit Mr. Quelp. Perhaps we will meet again.",
"Congratulations on your promotion Captain Hornblower. My orders are to sail as your escort to #sisland_Cayman#, Sir. When do we sail?",
"Thank you Lieutenant. I have to crew and reprovision the Hotspur, so we shall sail tomorrow morning on the first tide.",
"Yes Sir. My ship will be ready and waiting your orders by first light.",
"Very well Lieutenant. Till the morning.",
"My duties as escort end here Commander. May I say it has been a pleasure sailing with you.",
"I shall sail shortly Sir, but I would beg a favour of you. I lost my bosun overboard on the trip. The fool got drunk and fell overboard. I wonder Sir, if you would be kind enough to release Wolfe to me as a replacement?",
"What? Er.. Why? Er.. Well I suppose so, Mr. Quelp. Wolfe. Report to Lieutenant Quelp's ship.",
"Thank you Commander. What are your orders here?",
"Oh! We are to liaise with the 95th... Er... Forget I said that Mr. Quelp. I have much on my mind at the moment.",
"I apologise Commander. I should not have pried, and I know your assignment is of great import. I will leave you to your business sir. Good day.",
"Good day sir.", 
"Ah, Commander Hornblower! Good to see you. My men will be here soon, then we can join your ship. I have a mission for you.",
"Drop the pretense, Quelp. We know you're the traitor we've been seeking.",
"Don't jump to conclusions. Remember, I did say that I was looking for the traitor too and that some of my actions might appear strange on the surface.",
"Yes, but Wolfe was more forthright when faced with the hangman's noose.",
"Oh, was he? Wolfe, did you really think you could save your life by betraying me?",
"What the... !",
"That saved you a hangman's fee, Hornblower.",
"It's ironic hearing you talk about betrayal, Quelp. I don't know where those soldiers came from, but now you have nowhere to run. You're under arrest.",
"It's even more amusing hearing you talk about those soldiers. They're Voltigeurs, fully equal to Sharpe's men. And since you like irony, you'll love what we're going to do.",
"Which is?",
"We'll take your ship the same way you took 'Le Rиve'. Then we'll attack #sEleuthera#.",
"Why? That would bring the United States into the war against France.",
"Think again, Hornblower. Who will the Americans see attacking them?",
"Of course! They'll think it is Britain who is attacking.",
"Without even declaring war. America won't like that at all. We'll let them 'heroically' drive us back, though any who follow us back to the beach will have to be killed, of course. And when word gets back to Washington, the United States will declare war on Great Britain.",
"So why are you betraying your country, Quelp?",
"I love my country! But I don't like who's running it. The French have shown the way - kill the king, kick out the aristocrats and establish a republic for the people.",
"And their idea of 'liberty' and 'fraternity' is that anyone who disagrees with the government is imprisoned or executed.",
"Of course. Anyone who does not support the revolution supports the aristocrats and shares their fate.",
"And as an officer of the King, it is my duty to stop you. This ends here!",
