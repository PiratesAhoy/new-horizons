"Styles, sir.",
"Carry on.",
"It seems very quiet, sir. Even those guards over there are sleepy.",
"They are expecting an attack on the main port, Styles. And that is on the other side of the island.",
"So they won't think to look for us here?",
"Not unless we do something stupid. Now, quickly and quietly, follow me.",
"Which way now, sir?",
"Just follow me Styles, and be quiet.",
"The charges are laid, sir.",
"Good man. Now who has the fuses?",
"Wolfe, sir.",
"Where is he?",
"I don't know sir. I haven't seen him since we were in that jungle stuff.",
"Damn! This is going to take longer than I thought. We will have to lay a powder fuse. See to it Styles. The rest of you, back to the pass.",
"I've covered the charges with powder, sir, and laid a fuse trail half way down the hill.",
"Follow me then, Styles.",
"The fuse is lit, sir.",
"Cover you ears, Styles.",
"That should do it, sir. They won't be using that again for a long time now.",
"You're right Styles. Now, let's get back to the beach, and quickly.",
"Just through here and we're home, sir.",
"Yes Styles. But the French are right behind us, so don't waste time.",
"Where is the boat, sir?",
"And where are the marines?",
"Ahhh! Chained up in a bloody storeroom.",
"There could be worse prison cells, Styles. ",
"...",
"I should have spotted Wolfe for what he was. He took me for a fool. I carried that traitor aboard my ship.",
"What's those bells all about?",
"They must have sighted Pellew's squadron and the church is sounding the alarm. And we are stuck here and can do nothing about it!",
"Must be a big church, from the sound of that bell.",
"It is quite large.",
"You been in there, then sir?",
"Yes, with a rebel and a rifleman.",
"Lent you his picklock, sir?",
"We had something to collect, and a door to unlock, to get it.",
"Did you give it him back, sir?",
"What back?",
"The picklock, sir.",
"Why,... come to think of it.... No! I didn't.... What a fool I am! We were in a hurry at the church, so I stuffed it into my pocket, and then into my cuff when I changed back into my uniform. The guards missed it when they searched me!",
"There go the battery cannon, sir.",
"I hear them. The squadron is going to be smashed to pieces if we don't do something about it.",
"Shall you be using it then, sir?",
"Using what?",
"Of course! I can unlock the door. I just need to be sure I choose the right one though.",
"This cupboard's full of weapons sir.",
"Hand them out then Styles.",
"What now, sir?",
"We must find the way to the battery.",
"What were you doing there, sir?",
"Did you do it, sir?",
"Yes, the rifleman, Cooper, lent me his picklock.",
"Yes. I did quite well with it actually. These old locks are quite easy to turn, once you get the knack of it.",
"Did you see much through the hole in the door, sir?",
"Quite a lot. The cannon are on the upper level, and they are being supplied by a group of munitions men at our level.",
"So, what's the plan then, sir?",
"Simple really. The cannoneers will be deaf from their continual firing, so they won't hear us, but the munitions men supplying them won't be.",
"So we attack the munitions men first?",
"Exactly. First the munitions men, then up to the cannoneers. Be ready, as soon as we step out they will see us. Make every shot count, and every blade thrust true. Good luck men. Follow me.",
"Hotspur! They're killing our shipmates! Draw pistols and fire as you bear!",
"Styles!?",
"What now, sir? Spike the guns?",
"No Styles, we need a more permanent solution. You and Tompkins lay as many charges as you can down here. There's plenty of powder here abouts. I will look on the upper decking. Stanley, Wilks. You find us another way out of here. We can't go back the way we came.",
"All done sir, and the fuses are lit. We should get out of here now, sir.",
"Very good Styles. Now get the men and yourself over that wall.",
"We go to the beach and see if we can see the Hotspur, and better still that they see us!",
