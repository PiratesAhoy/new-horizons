"Five years a coxswain on the northern convoys.",
"A young lady in Leeds sir, with a swollen belly, and an angry father.",
"I'd be glad to sir.",
"Good man.",
"?",
"Hornblower. Time to surrender I think.", 
"WOLFE!",
"I hope you are all comfortable gentlemen? I am off now to capture your marines, who think they are going to capture the battery.",
"You are a traitor Wolfe..",
"I should have stretched your neck when I had the chance.",
"I shall surrender, if you vouch my men will not be harmed.",
"Well, this is a turnabout. Me being your prisoner.",
"Indeed. How did you get that sloop?",
"I made it to #sPointe a Pitre#, which was in total chaos thanks to your raid.",
"And then?",
"The sloop's crew were in a panic and desperate for someone to give them orders. So I did. I told them we were going to #sFalaise de Fleur# to report the raid. Some British captain did the same when #sOxbay# was attacked about 50 years ago.", 
"And now you can hang.",
"If you do that, you'll never meet my boss.", 
"We already have. Captain Hammond is dead.",
"Black Charlie? He may have been a big noise in your navy, but he wasn't the boss.",
"So who is the boss, then?",
"I may as well tell you since you'll get it out of me one way or another. You're after Uriah Quelp. But you won't get him except by letting me out of here.",
"And why should we do that?",
"I'm supposed to meet him somewhere near #sSanto Domingo#. And don't ask me what he plans to do then because he never told me.",
"Perhaps he doesn't trust you for some reason.",
"Sarcasm won't get you Quelp. Neither will I unless you get me out of here.",
"Alright, but I'll need to see the prison commandant first.",
"We go inland. He should be near a windmill.",
"Alright, let's go.",
