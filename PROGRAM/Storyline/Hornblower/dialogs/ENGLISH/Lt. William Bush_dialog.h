"Hello Hornblower. All's well with you I trust?",
"Yes thank you, Lieutenant.",
"I am Second Lieutenant William Bush reporting for duty. Where might I find the Captain?",
"He is not aboard as yet, Lieutenant. I am Third Lieutenant Horatio Hornblower. Perhaps you would like to stow your dunnage while we wait for him? I need to get to the wheel deck.",
"Pleased to meet you Mr. Hornblower. Yes I shall do that.",
"We can talk later, Sir.",
"Ah! Thank you, Lieutenant. Yes, sir.",
".",
"...",
"There's more of them coming. Get to the wheel deck ",
", Get to the wheel. We must be sure we have the ship. Archie, check below. Sharpe's men must be down there. And find Lt. Buckland and Captain Sawyer.",
"Captain Hornblower! I thought it was you.",
"Mr. Bush! But I'm no longer a captain, I have no ship... and no epaulettes, so I too am a lieutenant. Anyway, what are you doing here?",
"I come here every month to collect my half pay and I stay where it's cheap.",
"Yes, Lieutenant.",
"Well, come and stay at my lodgings. I assure you it's cheap there.",
"I don't mind paying in advance madam.",
"You have an admirer. Your landlady's daughter. I saw the way she looked at you.",
"MARIA? No! No, no, no. Nonsense.",
"We will see Horatio. We will see.",
"Come along. I'll show you how I supplement my meager pay at the apothecary's house.",
"The apothecary's? Have you got into medicine?",
"No. The apothecary just lets us use the room. There is a private card game there of an evening, and I do quite well at it. Follow me.",
"What do you think he wants?",
"Well... I doubt he wants to play whist.",
".",
"It doesn't look like we will be needing to blow open the door.",
"What do you mean Mr. Bush?",
"Take a look ",
". If I'm not mistaken, the fort commander has just surrendered.",
"That's most odd. Most odd indeed. We need to see what's going on here.",
"Something's not right here ",
". The Spanish surrendered far too easily. Wait here while Mr. Kennedy and I take a look around.",
"Aye, aye Mr. Bush.",
"We are all ready then? All the fuses set?",
"Then let's get the blazes out of here. Across the bridge as fast as you can.",
"Get ready gentlemen. Any moment now.",
"Nicely done! Nicely done gentlemen. I think we can call that mission accomplished.",
"I think so Mr. Bush.",
"Time to be getting back to the ship gentlemen.",
"Mr. Kennedy and I are done in here. If you are ready we can go outside and set the fuses.",
"I took a nasty cut in the belly I'm afraid ",
"We need to get you to the sick bay.",
"Lieutenant Bush come aboard, Sir.",
"I arrived only a few minutes before you Sir. I wished to present myself personally. And may I say sir, what an honour it is to serve under a captain with so distinguished a record.",
"What are you two gentlemen talking about?",
"Er... the weather Mr. Bush. It looks as though it's blowing up a bit.",
"Yes it is blowing up now. We shall have to get some sail off her.",
"Aye aye, Mr. Bush.",
"We need to reef the topsail.",
"The Captain has to be informed first Sir. Standing Orders.",
"Very well. Mr. Kennedy, if you would please.",
"Gentlemen. We are required to attend the Captain in his cabin.",
"Sir.. I believe that Mr. Hornblower was only making an observation.",
"Gentlemen... mind your words. What you are suggesting here bounds upon mutiny! And I do not need to remind you of the penalty for that offence.",
"But the option Mr. Bush is to risk the ship and the crew in the face of the enemy.",
"That may be so Mr. Hornblower, but as Mr. Buckland pointed out, it is for Doctor Clive to decide.",
"It would seem we are not alone, gentlemen!",
"They must be part of the rebel army Buckland was talking about.",
"That's as may be Mr. Hornblower, but they aren't going to let us pass, and there's too many of them for us to take on. What would you suggest we do?",
"Quite simple Mr. Bush... Archie... Fire that cannon if you please.",
"Very ingenious Horatio. Very ingenious. But how did you know the cannon would be loaded?",
"I didn't... It just seemed logical that the Spanish wouldn't have had a manned cannon out here to protect the bridge, if it wasn't loaded.",
"Hmmm. Your logic, or perhaps luck, never fails to astound me, Horatio. But back to more pressing matters. Are all the fuses set?",
"What did the admiral want?",
"A Commander... for the 'Hotspur'.",
"Congratulations Horatio, er, Sir. He couldn't have chosen a better man.",
"Thank you, but she's hardly the 'Renown'.",
"But she's a fine ship Sir.",
"You think so?",
"Yes I think so.",
"Do you also think, Mr. Bush that a lieutenant who served on a seventy-four, might be happy to serve as lieutenant on a mere sloop?",
"If you were captain, Sir, I believe he would.",
"Then would you do me the honour of being my first lieutenant?",
"It is I who would be honoured Sir.",
"I was afraid you wouldn't want to.",
"I was afraid you wouldn't ask.",
"Well, we have a ship to rig.",
"Aye aye, Captain.",
"First we need to go to the tavern to hire a crew.",
"We can always find a place for Matthews, Sir.",
"You want to add to our troubles, do you Styles? [Sir?] Styles, you never cease to amaze me. [Thank you Sir].",
"Experience?",
"What brings you to port?",
"Sign here, Wolfe.",
"Well that fills the crew, Sir. I suppose that we should get back to Mrs. Mason's and pack our sea chests?",
"Yes, you're right, William. Let's get a move on, or we will get no sleep tonight.",
"Captain, I've finished packing, and with your permission, Sir. I would like to sleep on board the 'Hotspur' tonight in order to get the crew ready for the morning.",
"Very well, Mr. Bush. Permission granted, I will see you on board in the morning.",
"Yes Sir. I will bid you goodnight then.",
"Goodnight, Mr. Bush.",
"What was that all about?",
"I don't know, William, but I feel uneasy about it, and I don't know why.",
"What I don't understand is why he would ask you for a bosun, when he could go to the local tavern and more than likely find one there?",
"Let's drop the subject for the moment, William. Quelp and I go back a while, and it was never good. I need time to think. Let's get on and find the 95th.",
"Yes Captain. Sorry Sir. We could try the tavern. Mr. Chadd is minding the ship so I gave some of the crew shore leave. They are probably there by now and they may have heard something.",
"Yes, let's do that.",
"Do you think it is wise to join with a band of Guerillas sir?",
"We have orders to find Major Hogan and it's our only option right now. Come on, William, we need to get some sleep. I will get a room from the bar keeper.",
"Morning sir. The ship and crew are ready and the riflemen are on board.",
"Very well, Mr. Bush. Let's go and see if our fellow 'Guerillas' are ready.",
"Your orders Captain?",
"Take the 'Hotspur' out to sea. I don't want her caught here in the bay. Stay out of sight of land for a day, then close in. We should be back here in the Commadante's ship by then. If we are not here you are to take the 'Hotspur' and report to Admiral Pellew.",
"Thank you Mr. Bush. ",
"And remember, Do Not Engage the French. We are still at peace as far as we know.",
"Thank God you're back, sir. We were starting to worry, the riflemen are aboard, but there are a lot of French ships about. We need to board at once.",
"Calm down Mr. Bush. Did you meet with Commadante Moreno's ship?",
"Yes sir. That's why I took the liberty of bringing the 'Hotspur' inshore.",
"Good. We need to get to #sGreenford# and Admiral Pellew with all speed. Board and weigh anchor Mr. Bush. I will tell you all about it on the way.",
"The admiral has obviously read your report, sir.",
"Yes Mr. Bush. I wonder what he made of it.",
"He values your opinion, sir. Doubtless he wants to discuss his further plans with you.",
"We will see, Mr. Bush. We will see. Make sure the ship is reprovisioned while I'm gone. I have a feeling we won't be staying here too long.",
"Captain, the ship is provisioned and ready for sea, and Wolfe has been released from the Sophie, so he is back with us.",
"Thank you Mr. Bush. Wolfe, get aboard. To sea Mr. Bush. We are to sail to Anse Casse Bois on #sisland_Guadeloupe#, then cross the island, to the so called lighthouse, and destroy the semaphore.",
"That sounds more like it, Captain.",
"It's bigger than that. Captain Hammond is to attack and destroy the battery in the fort, so Admiral Pellew can sail in and destroy the French fleet.",
"That will stop the French from pursuing their invasion plans.",
"Exactly, Mr. Bush. Exactly. Now let's get to the ship, the 'Hotspur' is expected to make a good showing of herself in this venture.",
"Look sir, there's Captain Hammond and Lieutenant Quelp. Perhaps if we hurry we can share a boat with them back to the ship?",
"No hurry, Mr. Bush. Our boat is there too. I see Wolfe is on the dock as well. I wonder why he doesn't just get into our boat? Perhaps he is waiting for us. Anyway, let's get to sea, Mr. Bush. We've a semaphore to blow up.",
"All ready to go ashore Mr. Bush.",
"Stand the men down Matthews. The Admiral has other plans for us.",
"But sir, we could be there and back before he even knew about it.",
"Are you suggesting mutiny man?",
"No sir! I just wish...",
"So do I Matthews. We'll support the action. Stand by to go in with the squadron. [Aye aye, sir.]",
"Mr. Hammond, Mr. Matthews, report to the quarter deck.",
"Aye, aye, sir.",
"We have a signal to sail line astern of the Flagship. We will be at action stations soon.",
"I don't much like this, sir.",
"Relax Matthews. Captain Hammond has seen to the guns.",
"Alter course to port!",
"If we do we'll run aground sir.",
"If we don't we'll be smashed to pieces! Alter course. We'll run in under the guns and storm ashore in the boats.",
"Aye aye, Sir! HARD APORT!",
"We've done our bit, sir. Now it's up to Admiral Pellew.",
"Yes, William, and from the sound of those guns, he's making a good job of it.",
"The 'Hotspur' has taken a bit of a beating, sir, but we could rejoin the squadron and the fight.",
"No, William, as you said, we have done our bit. We need to get the 'Hotspur' back to #sGreenford# for repairs. We will wait for the squadron there.",
"Sir, Wolfe is in prison.",
"Good. That traitor will finally get his proper reward.",
"And sir, I met Lieutenant Sharpe. He would like to join in the interrogation. He will meet you in the prison.",
"Thank you, Mr. Bush. That will be all for now.",
"Thank you for allowing me to be here, sir. And may I be the first to congratulate the two of you and wish you a long and happy marriage.",
"Thank you, Mr. Bush.",
"A rum looking lot, eh, sir?",
"They're His Majesty's allies, Mr. Bush.",
"Allies, sir? I thought this part of the world belonged to Spain.",
" has been persuaded by England to revolt against Spain.",
"Then our cargo of arms is for him?",
"If ",
" can conquer Cuba, Spain will have to take ships and soldiers from Napoleon to preserve her colonies.",
"Mr. Bush, here are the keys to my dispatch box containing the Admiralty's orders. If I'm not back aboard by midnight, you'll assume command.",
"Not back aboard, sir? But you said they were on our side.",
"War breeds strange allies, Mr. Bush.",
"Prepare the boats for storing ship, Mr. Bush. There are enough provisions coming aboard to make us independent for two months. Our cargo goes ashore.",
"Aye aye, sir.",
"Oh, and Mr. Bush, there's a Spanish ship of 60 guns due here before dawn. Send your best lookout to the top of that hill to warn us of the enemy's approach.",
"Lookout station reports 'Natividad' sighted, sir.",
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Bush, we'll have the lights out.",
"ALL LIGHTS OUT!",
"Shall I stop the loading, sir?",
"No, we've a few hours yet.",
"Aren't we going to run for open water, sir?",
"No, we'll remain at anchor here, under the lee of this point.",
"Oh, and Mr. Bush, would you and Mr. Gerard and Mr. Longley give me the pleasure of your company at supper tonight?",
"Thank you, sir! Er - tonight, sir?",
"Our young midshipman may be risking his life before dawn, Mr. Bush. His stomach might feel better with a meal in it.",
"That's the Spanish for you. I'd been gambling that they'd do exactly that.",
"Now, gentlemen, here's what I plan to do. Mr. Bush, pick a squad of the best swimmers in the crew, then issue them weapons.",
"Mr. Bush, would you remove the officers to the '",
"' and put them in irons.",
"Ah, she's a beauty, sir. The purser reckons she's worth 120,000 guineas. That gives every man jack aboard '",
"' 50 guineas prize money.",
"The 'Natividad' is not a prize ship, Mr. Bush.",
"I beg your pardon, sir?",
"She's to be used by our ally, Don Julian.",
"You're giving her away, sir? But your own share would be worth 10,000.",
"I asked for no figures.",
"But sir, you yourself said that Don Julian was mad. Can you trust him?",
"Rest easy, Mr. Bush. I alone will have to answer to the Admiralty for this decision.",
"Don Julian is coming aboard, sir.",
"An 11 gun salute, Mr. Bush",
"Aye aye, sir. FIRE!",
"Mr. Bush, we're returning to the ",
"What is she, Mr. Bush?",
"Spanish lugger, sir. Flying a white flag. That'll mean a parley.",
"Run out a gun.",
"Bring the prisoners here.",
"Mr. Bush, I'll have you remind everyone that this is still a ship of war!",
"Signal from the flagship, sir. All captains come aboard.",
"Oh, very good Mr. Bush. Acknowledge and clear away the gig.",
"ACKNOWLEDGE! CLEAR AWAY THE CAPTAIN'S GIG!",
