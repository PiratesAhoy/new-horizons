"I am Midshipman ",
"Well, Midshipman, you should be aware that I don't waste my time with junior ranks. Go take you problem to one of my officers.",
"Sorry to have bothered you Major.",
"What do you want Lieutenant? .",
"Oh! I apologise Major. I thought you were someone else. I will bid you good day.",

"Indeed sir! I heard that that Wellesley himself promoted him.",
"Wellesley! Pah! There are doubts that he knows how to run an army in a proper manner himself.",

"Thank you sir. I have orders here from Admiral Pellew and Colonel Wellesley for your attention.",
"Sharpe? The fellow that Wellesley raised from the ranks? You want him?",
"Yes Major. He is vital to my mission.",
"If you say so. Take him and go. He and his troop will be outside.",
"Lieutenant! Dismiss the men they will need their rest before the battle tomorrow.",
"...",
"Not you Sharpe! Take your men and see what the terrain is like for tomorrow. ",
"We have standards here. An officer must behave like a gentleman. Even if he is not a gentleman.",
