"Good day Lieutenant.",
"Good day Sir Arthur.",
"So Pellew, why the call to join you? Sounds like something is afoot?",
"[THINKS: What a beautiful girl! And she is the major's sister.]",
"Captain. I think we will get more done if Sharpe, Harper and I repair to the prison and interrogate the other prisoner there, while you continue your discussion. We can meet at the Academy later. Good day Sir. And you Lieutenant.",
"Oh! Yes. Good day Major.",
"Your Mr. Quelp couldn't wait to go to the smuggler's house to get things set up for me could he? And from what we learned from the prisoner, it is indeed me the French wish to eliminate.",
"So what do we do now Sir?",
"We have two choices. Mr. Quelp will no doubt be scurrying along the tunnel as we speak, to alert the French that I will be in the house later today.", 
"No doubt Sir.",
"So Mr. Sharpe here can take his detachment and wait for them to emerge from the tunnel and then deal with them accordingly, or we could take advantage of the time Quelp and the French will take to get organised, and use the beach tunnel to get to your ship and sail for #sRedmond#.",
"So it's fight or flight, then Sir.",
"If you wish to put it that way, yes Lieutenant, fight or flight. Which is your pleasure?",
"With respect, I would prefer both Sir. Fight THEN flight.",
"Explain yourself Lieutenant.",
"Well Sir, if Mr. Sharpe sets up his troop in the main room, I could go into the back room and entice Quelp and the French out when they arrive. Sharpe and his men will then despatch them.",
"That's the fight part taken care of. And the flight?",
"When the French are taken care of, you and I could use the beach tunnel, get to my ship, and make for #sRedmond#. With no one left alive the French back at the pirate camp will not know what happened, or where you went.",
"Damnation! They were not just ordinary infantrymen. They were crack troops. Higgins, see to our men I think they are only wounded. No sign of Quelp though, that seems odd? We need to get to your ship ", 
"Aye, Major. It is indeed odd, but I fear we need to move out of here quickly. This way to the tunnel.",
". We will worry about Quelp later.", 
"You did a damn fine job. Both of you. They just brought Edrington out and he told me how you defeated the French.",
"Thank you Sir Arthur, but we don't know if the French intend to land reinforcements on the beach yet.",
"Sir",
"That won't be happening. We managed to turn round the ship that landed our troops and she chased the French ship off, so there will be no more troops landing.",
"[THINKS: So why didn't our troops come back to us? They must have heard the cannon.]",
"Anyway, I have a more pleasant task for you. You are to take these documents to #sGreenford#, to the Naval H.Q. there. With all speed mind you. Do you understand?",
"Thank you Sir Arthur.",
"Good.... Lieutenant Sharpe. I want you to take command of the Second Battalion while Edrington recovers. That will be all gentlemen. Good day.",
".",
"My turn for introductions Lieutenant. To your left is Lieutenant William Chumley, to your right, rifleman Sharpe of the 33rd Foot.",
"Gentlemen.",
"Lieutenant Chumley will be in command of the main detachment, and Sharpe, the skirmishers.",
"Skirmishers Sir? I thought this was to be a battle?",
"Lieutenant. The skirmishers are somewhat unusual in that they are all crack shots. We are thinking of setting them up in their own detachment, but that is another matter.",
"I see Sir.",
"Good. Captain Pellew has pointed out to me that to take the Indefatigable inshore on such a mission would attract too much attention from the French before we could get near to shore and risk drawing their fleet down upon us.",
"I can see that Sir. We would be trapped in the bay in shallow water. Which would mean little room to maneuver, and that would put the 'Indy' at a major disadvantage.",
"Mmmm. Well, you lieutenant will command a smaller vessel which will carry the troops and you will land them on the beach. You will obviously provide the means of their extraction after the battle. Do you understand?",
"Yes Major. Completely.",
"Good Day Commander. I was sorry to hear about young Kennedy. A brave man. But, I must concern myself with the matter at hand. I am about to launch an offensive to clear the French out of the Caribbean.",
"Indeed Sir Arthur?",
"Yes. We intend to start by pushing the blighters off of Guadeloupe. But I am having a bit of a problem, which you and Sharpe here I think can solve for me.",
"Yes. Ever since that damn tunnel business in Charlestown, someone has been leaking my plans and trying to kill me. Now Sharpe here has some ideas, but needs a ship to follow them through, and Commodore Pellew has offered your services. Are you up for it Commander?",
"Why... Er... Yes Sir of course, but I'm not sure that I can be of much assistance in the matter.",
"Poppycock man! You're just the man I need, and with Sharpe and his rifles along, I know I need fear no more. I will bid you good day gentlemen, and leave you to sort out the details.",
"Ah! Commander Hornblower, good to see you are unharmed. How goes it with the French?",
"So far Sir, we are holding our own. Sharpe's riflemen are keeping them at bay, and we managed to destroy one of their cannon.",
"Capital Hornblower! Capital!",
"Yes Sir, but I don't know how long we can hold out until the French realise all we have is a few seamen and riflemen, and mount a full charge upon us. We couldn't hold against such a force Sir.",
"Not to worry Hornblower. The ship carrying the rest of the Second Battalion has been sighted heading for the port. Can you hold the French off for another hour, do you think?",
"We will do our best Sir.",
"Good man! Then I will get back and relay the word that the reinforcements should come straight here when they disembark.",
"Thank you, Sir.",
"Damn fine shooting that.",
"What's your name?",
"Sharpe... Sergeant. Second Battalion 95th Rifles Sir.",
"I'm much obliged to you. You did me a damn good turn. Now I'm going to do you a damn bad one. I'm giving you a field commission Sharpe. From this moment on you are a lieutenant in the 95th.",
"Thank you Sir.",
"Edrington, you will pass the word on this promotion, and I suggest you allow Lieutenant Sharpe to use his troop as he sees fit in the upcoming engagement. That will be all.",
"Hornblower! Sharpe! You are indeed a sight for sore eyes! We are under attack by the French from the beach. I cannot take troops from the fort for fear that this is a ruse and they actually intend to invade the port.",
"What do you need us to do Sir Arthur?",
"You and Sharpe take your men to the outskirts and stop the French from getting into the town.",
"Aye aye Sir Arthur.... Matthews! take Oldroyd and Styles and go and see what's going on.",
"This is going to be a close run thing gentlemen. The main body of troops are on a ship on their way to #sisland_Guadeloupe# to establish a foothold for my impending attack. I have sent a chase ship to get them to return, but that will take time.",
"We will go to the outskirts and hold that position to protect your flank Sir Arthur.",
"Good man. I must stay here and organise what few troops I have left. Now get yourselves off, we don't have much time, but I know I can rely on you.",
"Good to see you again Hornblower.",
"Likewise Sir. It is good to see you.",
"As to the plan Admiral, I doubt this temporary peace with the French will last long, so we need to be one step ahead of them.",
"...",
"We have that aspect of the operation covered Captain Hornblower. You remember Lieutenant Sharpe of the 95th?",
"Why, yes Colonel, very well indeed.",
"Good. Well, he and Major Hogan work, shall we say, closely together. Sharpe will lead you to Hogan. Sharpe is presently serving in Major Dunnitt's Company of the 95th.",
"Here are Sharpe's release orders seconding him, and his men, to you. Give them to Captain Murray when you reach the 95th.",
"Er, Colonel. Where are the 95th?",
"They are on the Cayman Island.",
