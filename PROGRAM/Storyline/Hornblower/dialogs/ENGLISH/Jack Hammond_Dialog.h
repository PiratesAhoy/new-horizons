"Midshipman Hammond, sir.",
"Carry on.",
"Midshipman Hammend, sir.",
"Carry on.",
"Well... there is one man Sir... but he's not a captain. I've read much of your exploits Sir.",
"Oh! I'm sorry, I'm in no position to offer you anything.",
"Mr. Hornblower, why are you a lieutenant again and no longer a commander?",
"Because my promotion was disallowed when the Retribution was laid up.",
"Commander Hornblower, sir. There is a signal from the Flagship, sir. You are to report on board.", 
"Thank you Mr. Hammond.",
"I'd like to volunteer too, sir.",
"Very well Mr. Hammond. It is time men, to the boats and the shore, and be as quiet as you can.",
"Captain! The semaphore operator is stood on the cliff over there. He might see us.",
"Calm down Mr. Hammond.... Styles, you know what you need to do. He won't hear you till it's too late. He has the wind blowing in his ears standing up there. We will follow just behind you.",
"We need to be quick, sir. I think I heard a French alarm trumpet sound.",
"We won't be long now Mr. Hammond. You stay here and keep watch. The rest of you lay the charges inside the tower.",
"That will take too long sir. I heard the trumpet again. We.. We will be trapped up here.",
"Stand Steady Mr. Hammond! Get yourself back to the beach and tell Mr. Matthews we are delayed and to make ready with the marines for a fire fight as we return.",
"...", 
"He ordered you to withdraw the marines?",
"He saw the French reinforcements advancing on the signal post, sir. He told me to run ahead and evacuate the jetty. But we wanted to wait for him, sir.", 
"Thank you Mr. Hammond. Return to your duties.",
"Mr. Matthews.",
"All ready are we sir. Nowhere to run to now.",
"A word if you please. I'll have you know Matthews I don't much care for your tone.",
"Well sir, I must say I don't give a tinker's cuss what you care for. Captain Hornblower never ordered you to clear that jetty. [You weren't there.] He would never have given up that easy. Though you might.",
"You don't know what happened.",
"I know he gave you a chance to prove yourself. He's done that for many a man. Me, Styles and nobody's ever let him down, till now. If that's all you have to say sir, I've got work to do.",
"Let's hope we can count on your uncle, sir.",
"Flagship signalling, sir. All ships... then... withdraw, sir.",
"Are you sure?",
"Yes sir.",
"Better check it. Look it up in the book.",
"Aye, aye, sir....but... I am sure, sir.",
