"Good to see you Commander.",
"Good to see you too, Major.",
"Ah! Richard my boy, and Teresa. And who is this with you?",
"Commander Hornblower, Major, with a missive from Sir Arthur Wellesley and Admiral Pellew. I believe it will confirm my credentials.",
"Credentials is it? Being in the company of Richard and Teresa are credentials enough for me, Commander. But I'd better be reading them anyway.",
"Here you are Major.",
"Hmmm, Sir Arthur is still the same old fox. He always did keep a close eye on his friends. Especially if he thought they might become his enemies.",
"Major?",
"Don't be worrying yourself Commander. As it happens I have been keeping an eye on our recent allies myself. I have written it all down, troop numbers, ships and armament. It's all here, take this to Sir Arthur and the Admiral.", 
"Major, from the troop movements I have seen, in the short time I have been here, it looks like the French are building up an invasion force.",
"Invasion force is it? Now that's only half the answer. The important part is, where do they intend to invade? And that is in my report.",
"I see.",
"You'll be needing to see very well in the next day or so. You will need to get off this island and get this report back post haste.",
"Yes Major. I believe my business here is done.",
"Ah! the holy relic no doubt, Teresa. I was forgetting that was here. Commander, You will be needing to help Teresa collect that before you leave.",
"But your dispatches, major?",
"They will keep a little longer. The relic is important too. Anyway, a few hours in church will probably do you good Commander, but you can't go dressed like that.",
"We have civilian clothes for me and Mr Sharpe, Major.",
"Good. Good. You can change in the bedroom over there. But Richard won't be going with you.", 
"Richard. Your old commanding officer, Major Dunnitt, and his troop are camped behind the house. The fool thinks he is going to defend this place against the French. I need you to get as many men out as you can before that happens.",
"But that means you must come with us Major.", 
"Rest easy Commander. I am accepted here as a local. As busy as they are, the French will want him out of here very soon. They will come to my 'rescue' soon.",
"But Major... Dunnitt and his men will be killed.",
"Dunnitt was not ordered to come here. He overheard a conversation somewhere that I was here, and decided to come here and get some quick glory for himself.",
"But his men sir?",
"Dunnitt will have got them killed trying to get them back off the island, if not here. Hopefully Sharpe will get some of them out before that happens.",
"The fog of war.",
"The fog of war it is Commander. Richard, when the commander has changed, report to Dunnitt. ",
"I could take two of the men with me to the church. But I still think you should come with us Major.",
"Don't fret Commander, I am well protected. The 'slaves' you see out there are actually soldiers of the West India Regiment, and they know this island backwards. We will melt into the landscape before the French arrive. ",
"Good. That does it for now I think. I will go and change my clothes.",
"Teresa's man's suit looks good on you Hornblower. Now, get youselves off to Dunnitt. Out of the house, turn right and over the footbridge. Sharpe will know what to do from there.",
"Yes Major.",
"Your men are ready Commander. Good Luck.",
"Thank you Major.",
"Welcome back, Commander.",
"Good day, Major. I see your cover here is still good.",
"Yes, I'm still here. I thanked the fort commander for heroically defending my plantation against the British raids, and as that's the only honour he's getting out of the whole affair he didn't question it too hard. Now, what can I do for you?",
"Midshipman Wolfe turned out to be a traitor and I'm looking for him. He was last seen running from a battle on the beach in a French uniform.", 
"The beach, was it? One of my men saw a French officer, or what looked like one, bolting through the jungle that day, so he followed him. Said officer went into port, boarded a sloop named 'Loup-Garou', and started yelling orders. My lad couldn't make out much but he did hear '#sisland_Falaise de Fleur#', so I'm guessing that's where your man went.",
"Thank you, Major. I'll see if I can find that sloop anywhere near #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#.",
