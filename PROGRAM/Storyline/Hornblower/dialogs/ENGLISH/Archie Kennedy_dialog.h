"Alright.. are you Horatio?",
"Yes, I think so.",
"Horatio. You've.. er.. got some.. er.. stuff on your sleeve.",
"Oh! Thanks Archie. What do we do now?",
"You heard the Lieutenant. Get the ship underway. Come on.. to the quarter deck.",
"I'm right behind you.",
"! Lieutenant Bracegirdle is telling everyone how you killed Simpson with just one blow! And look at you in your fine new uniform. Might I ask lieutenant, whose pretty ass did you have to kiss for that?",
"Calm down Archie! It was two blows! Ha! Ha! It seems I am to be left behind while the 'Indy' goes to #sisland_Antigua#. All I'm left with is the jolly boat!",
"Ah! A new lieutenant. A new ship. And a new shipload of trouble I'll be bound. I am to sail with the 'Indy' so we must part company for now.",
"Archie! Stop it! At least Simpson won't be there to bother you. Good luck. I'm off to sleep for a while, I'm exhausted. Then I must find Mr. Hunter.",
"Yes we do, but what are we going to do about it?",
"Right now Archie, we are going to follow orders. Go to Naval Headquarters. It's up here by the round garden I think.",
"Stop! Stop! The captain's coming aboard.",
"I didn't start it!",
"That won't matter when the captain gets here.",
"Understood.",
"! What are you doing here?",
"A long story Archie. What's wrong with you? You don't look well?",
"Leave me alone ",
". You don't know what it's like here. They will grind you down till you are nothing.",
"Archie! Get a grip of yourself. We are going to make plans to escape.",
"Escape! Escape! Don't you think I haven't tried that? Four times I got away. Each time I was captured again. The last time they put me in a hole in the ground where I could neither sit nor stand for a month. I've had enough.",
"It will be different this time Archie. We are all in it together this time.",
"Leave me alone. Just leave me alone.",
"Don't worry Archie. You will get better. You'll see.",
". I am still weak, but I am feeling more like my old self.",
"Good man. At least you are on your feet again.",
"Leave me alone. Leave me alone.",
"Archie! Rest man. Rest.",
"Your Grace? Your Grace? She's no Duchess ",
". She's an actress from Drury Lane. I used to see her there all the time.",
"What! You must be mistaken Archie.",
"I think not ",
". The theatre was one of my favourite pastimes. I've seen her in many plays.",
"No, no. You are still a little delirious Archie.",
"Her name is Catherine Cobham. She is an actress I tell you.",
"She is a duchess Archie. I met her in #sRedmond#.",
"The Spanish ship is breaking up on the reef ",
". What can we do?",
"Everyone to the boat and row like hell out to her. We can save some of them at least.",
"Captain. I have spoken to the crew, and if the parole stands for Mr. ",
", then it stands for us too. All of us.",
"...",
"It's just like old times ",
". Just like old times. I suppose we could plan an escape.",
"Yes we could. It is our duty after all.",
"It just doesn't seem right in a way. I mean with Don Masseredo treating us so reasonably.",
"The mists of war Archie. The mists of war. Things do tend to get very confusing at times.",
", good to see you again. That was one hell of a battle with the French, I hear.",
"Yes Archie. It was a close call, but do you know about our new orders to join the 'Renown'?",
"Yes, Captain James Sawyer and the Renown. How lucky are we? One of the most famous captains in the whole navy. We are to go to #sGreenford# to join ship I understand. How do we get there?",
"Walk.",
"Walk? Now that's NOT why I joined the navy.",
"Never mind Archie. The exercise will do us good. Come on next stop #sGreenford# we'd better get going. Captain Sawyer doesn't like to be kept waiting I hear.",
"We'll never get through there ",
". The Spanish have seen the ship AND US! They have obviously got their guns trained on the pass. We will do better trying the old rope bridge.",
"Yes Archie, you're right. Let's go there.",
"How are we going to take the fort ",
"I will use the gunpowder to blow the door. When it goes... everyone into the fort. There shouldn't be that many guards.",
"Lieutenant Quelp's comments about a slave army seems to be true. There's hardly any food in this place at all. The Spanish wouldn't have lasted more than a few days with what they had left.",
"We will have to worry about that later Archie. Right now we must see about blowing this place up. Did you find any gunpowder?",
"Plenty! That they did have. Just no food. There's a lot of it stacked around the courtyard here.",
"Very well. Let's split up and lay the charges, then meet outside the gate.",
"I took a shot in the stomach ",
"We must get you to the surgeon Archie",
"Well, THAT wasn't the welcome I was expecting!",
"I know Archie, but he seemed to be under a lot of strain. Perhaps things will be better when we get to sea.",
"I hope so.",
"Let's get aboard then.",
"There's a boat coming alongside Horatio.",
"Is it the captain?",
"No, but it is an officer.",
"Very well, I will take care of it. Go and check the quarterdeck Archie. I will check the helmsman.",
"The Captain doesn't appear to be the man I thought he was.",
"Now, now Archie. He has a lot to think about.",
"That's as maybe, Horatio. But he flies off the handle far too quickly for my liking.",
"Archie! That's enough.",
"How is Mr. Wellard?",
"He'll be alright by the morning Archie.",
"He was only doing his duty Horatio. The Captain went berserk and there was no need nor justification for it.",
"Hush Archie, Mr. Bush is coming.",
"The Captain is worse ",
"I know Archie and it worries me.",
"Sir... It was I.... I pushed Captain Sawyer into the hold.",
