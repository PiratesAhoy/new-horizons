"Good day Lieutenant.",
"Good day Don Masseredo.",
"I am Don Masseredo. Commandant of the Fortress Prison. You are now prisoners of Spain.",
"I am Lieutenant ",
", of His Britannic Majesty's Ship Indefatigable. At your service Sir.",
"Lieutenant. You and your men will be taken to the sea fort where you will spend the rest of the war. If you show respect to me and the guards as your captors, you will be treated well.",
"Thank you your Excellency. That will be much appreciated.",
"However, should you try to escape, your treatment will be drastically changed.",
"To escape, your Excellency, is the duty of every British officer.", 
"Lieutenant. I have said all I intend to say on the subject. Guards! Lead them away.",
"...",
"Lieutenant ",
". Her Grace informs me that you are old acquaintances.",
"Er.. Yes your Excellency. That is so.",
"Ah! So. And she also informs me that she is in need of some company on her daily walks.",
"Indeed? Your Excellency.",
"You and your men have behaved well during your captivity Lieutenant. So if you will give me your parole that you will not try to escape, I will allow you to accompany her on her daily excursions. Do you agree Lieutenant?",
"Don Masseredo. I will give you my parole that I will not try to escape while walking with her Grace.",
"That is good Lieutenant.", 
"However Sir, I must advise you that outside those hours, I consider it my duty, as a British Officer, to try to escape.",
"Indeed Lieutenant. Well, so long as you don't try to murder me in my bed, I wish you every luck in your attempt. In the meantime the gate in the corner leads to the cliffs. Enjoy your walk.", 
"Thank you your Excellency.",
", I would be honoured for your presence at dinner tonight. I have a guest. Colonel Etienne de Vergasse of the French army.",
"Thank you your Excellency. It will be my pleasure.",
". May I present Colonel Etienne de Vergasse.",
"A pleasure to meet you Colonel.",
"Come, Colonel! A truce prevails here, fog and wind can make a fool of any man.",
"It is true there was an engagement off #sisland_Hispaniola# recently sir?",
"There was? You wish to embarrass a Spanish gentleman in front of his guests?",
"I have bad news for both of us Mr. ",
". The Duchess has left on a sloop, the Almaria, bound for Portugal. So our days will be longer from now on, I'm afraid.",
"Indeed your Excellency. Indeed they will.",
"However to lighten the days a little, I am letting your men join you on the beach for your walks.",
"Thank you your Excellency. I am sure they will be most grateful.",
" I hear there is a battle going on out there between one of your ships and one of ours. Pray tell me sir, what is the name of the British ship?",
"It is the Indefatigable your Excellency. It's my old ship.",
"Your ship has chased ours far inshore, but she is not catching her I see.", 
"No sir, but yours is carrying too much sail and she must tack soon. The 'Indy' will have her then.",
"The Almaria is a good sailor. She will be hard to catch.",
"The Almaria?",
"Don't worry, she has had time to sail to a port and unload her cargo.",
"She's lost her topsail! Good heavens she's heading for the reef.",
"Will she clear the reef?",
"Not with her topsails gone.",
"The Devil has her, she has struck the reef.",
"We must launch boats and try to save her. Give me a boat and my own men and we can save her crew at least.",
"Of course... and that would give you the perfect opportunity to escape.",
"Sir those men out there are dying. If we can take a boat we can save them.",
"But they are your enemies.",
"Sir, the sea does not take sides. Give me a boat I beg you.",
"You will give me your parole and that of your men that you will not escape.",
"I give you my word sir.",
"Go. There is a boat in the next bay. Follow the beach from where your men came from, you will find it. And God be with you.",
"And with the men out there.",
"You are not only a brave man Lieutenant ",
", but you are also a man of honour. I shall endeavour to make your stay with us as pleasant as the circumstances allow.",
", a letter has arrived concerning you, from their Excellencies in Madrid.",
"Yes Sir?",
"The first minister has informed me, that in recognition of your courage in saving lives at the peril of your own, you and your ship's crew are to be set at liberty.",
"We are free to go?",
"That is what I usually understand liberty to mean.",
"Thank you Sir. I am honoured by their Excellencies' consideration.",
"Mmmm... I wonder if their Excellencies realise they are setting free a man who will doubtless be a thorn in their side for many years to come.",
"I shall endeavour not to disappoint them Sir.",
"Mmmm... Well it is goodbye Mr. ",
". Your ship has been given leave to moor in the bay. You know where that is. Take your crew and go.",
"Goodbye your Excellency.",
