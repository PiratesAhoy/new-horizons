"You must be Hornblower?",
"Yes Captain.",
"Good to see you again Pellew, and you Mr. Bracegirdle. And you must be the Midshipman I'm hearing so much about.",
"Midshipman Hornblower, Captain. At your service.",
"Just so, Mr. Hornblower. I have a report here that the 'Indefatigable' needlessly interfered with the Justinian’s attack on the Téméraire. And Mr. Simpson here, informs me you were in command of the helm at the time.",
"Er yes, but...",
"My dear Pellew, I have no doubt of the situation during the battle. What concerns me, is what is Mr. Simpson doing giving ME a signal that was addressed to YOU, Pellew? Your reaction tells me that you knew nothing of it.",
"Indeed Pellew, I agree with your assessment of Mr. Hornblower. That leaves us with Mr. Simpson, and an act which at best I see as gross insubordination and at worst, intent to assist the enemy by interfering with a communication to a superior officer. What do you have to say Mr. Simpson?",
"Hmmm. Nice turn of the blade there Hornblower. That's one rotten apple we need worry about no longer. Mr. Bracegirdle, would you be kind enough to find a couple of marines to clear this mess up.",
"I think that played out rather well. Don't you agree Pellew?",
"Played out...?",
"Now that Mr. Hornblower has finally arrived, we may proceed with the business at hand.",
"Sorry Captain.",
"Midshipmen Clayton, Kennedy and Hornblower, your journey from England to the Caribbean was uneventful I hear. A quiet cruise at the King's expense! Ha ha! What!",
"Yes Sir, but..",
"QUIET! Hornblower. That was not a question. As uneventful as that was, I will assure you that matters will be of far more consequence here. We are surrounded by our enemies who are bound and determined to take over this archipelago. WE, gentlemen shall stop them.",
"[THINKS: AND there are pirates.]",
"AND there are pirates to be dealt with. You gentlemen will do your duty. You will continue to serve on the Justinian under the able captainship of Captain Keene.",
"[THINKS: OH NO! I had enough bullying on the journey down here.]",
"Captain Keene, You have a few words for these gentlemen, I'm sure?",
"--",
"Damn fine job gentlemen! What Pellew! Nelson! Don't you agree?",
"French Captain, French crew and a French ship. All in one day! And all done by a sergeant and an acting lieutenant! That's one for the Admiral's log. What!",
"Thank you Sir.",
"Come on boy... We won't eat you.",
"Lieutenant Hornblower. We meet again.... I am told that I am to have the pleasure of your company as my third lieutenant on the Renown.",
"The honour is all mine Captain Sawyer.",
"Honour! Honour Sir! ... I have heard of your exploits MR.... HORNBLOWER. Fast rising in the ranks, I'm told. With every ship a promotion. Be sure Sir, that things will not be as easy on the Renown",
"Sir?",
"I know your type Mr. Hornblower... clawing their way to success on the backs of their comrades and superiors. Only their way will do.",
"Captain, I protest!",
"Hear that Doctor Clive? Already he protests my authority!",
"Captain!",
"Enough Hornblower! ... And who are these 'gentlemen' you have in tow?",
"Acting Lieutenant Archie Kennedy and Midshipman Henry Wellard, Sir.",
"Henry Wellard.... He doesn't look like he could fight a ship's biscuit, let alone a Frenchman. Get yourselves aboard and make ready for sea. You, Mr. Hornblower will be officer of the watch.",
"Aye aye, Captain.",
"You came in my absence did you?",
"Did you report to the first lieutenant?",
"No Sir.",
"In my absence you should have reported to Mr. Buckland... Mr. Buckland, why did Mr. Bush not report to you?",
"Well Mr Bush, you are indeed welcome. In time you may indeed thank me. Very well.",
"Now let's get this ship underway. Course North by East.",
"Aye aye, Captain. North by East it is.",
"Loose the topsails. Loose the mainsail. Haul on the main lines. Jump to it laggards or I'll have the skin off your backs!",
"Aye aye, Sir. Loose the topsails. Loose the mainsail. Haul on the main lines.",
"So you want to take some sail off her Mr. Bush?",
"Yes Sir... With your permission.",
"Very well.... All hands. All hands to reef topsails! Haul the reef tackle! Haul!",
"Who is that! Who is that who DARES to countermand my orders?",
"Mr. Wellard! ... I should have known. GET DOWN HERE MR. WELLARD! I'll teach you to disobey me.",
"But Sir, there was a block tearing the sail!",
"Mr. Wellard is one of yours, I believe. Well we will see what a dozen strokes with Mr. Matthews' rattan does to dissuade him from disobeying me.",
"Gentlemen.. We have been tasked with taking the Spanish fort on Playa de Sabana.",
"Captain, Mr Kennedy and I were imprisoned there for a while, so we know the area.",
"Ah! Mr. Hornblower. Well of course we can rely on you for the latest information, can't we?",
"Don't play with me Sir! I know your type. Always listening, always plotting.",
"You too Mr. Bush? Yes.. it all makes sense, I have seen you all plotting against me. Plotting against me... Plotting..",
"I know you're down here. Plotting against me. Come out. Come out damn you!",
