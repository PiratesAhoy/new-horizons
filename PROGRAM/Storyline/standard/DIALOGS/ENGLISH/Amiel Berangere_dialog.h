"Hello, ",
". May I ask who you are and what the hell you're doing in my room?",
". I'm here to see you.",
". Really? I'd never have guessed. So what do you want, ",
"?",
"I know that you were hired to escort the 'Oiseau' bark.",
"Maybe... bah! I won't hide it. So I'm short on cash, that's why I agreed to sail to #sOxbay# and back for the trifling sum that French skinflint offered me.",
"What if I asked you to give me the honor of doing that?",
"If you want this job, you must be in even worse shape than I am. But why on earth should I let you have it?",
"Because if you refuse, I'll kill you.",
"I'll pay you more than the French. That shouldn't be hard.",
"We both know you don't really want to sail anywhere dangerous.",
"Thousand devils! Let's see if you're as good as you think!",
"I'll show you, scoundrel!",
"Just kidding. I'll pay you more than the French.",
"Pay me? You've got some gold after all, eh? So why do you want the job?",
"Never mind that...do we have a deal?",
"That's true, but I really need that gold, so what choice do I have?",
"If the pay is as trifling as you say, maybe you'd be wise to wait for a better offer?",
"I don't know.... Well, all right, but it'll cost you 3000 gold!",
"Here you are. 3000 gold exactly.",
"3000 gold? You must be joking.",
"I don't have that much on me.",
"You know something? You're right. To hell with all these soldiers and their colonial wars! Something better will come along before I starve.",
"Then let me do this work for you.",
"I've got one if you're interested.",
"No thanks, ",
". Who knows when I'll get a job again? I'm a lousy trader, and I'm not about to turn pirate...",
"Then I'll have to kill you.",
"I'll pay you more than the French.",
"Excellent! Someone up there really loves me!",
"Right. Calm down, and let's cut to the bottom line.",
"Alas then, ",
", I can't help you.",
"Then I'll have to kill you.",
"You and I both know you don't want to sail anywhere dangerous.",
"All right, we have a deal. Here's a note from the Governor to the head of the port. Show it to him, and he'll introduce you to ",
"Virgile Boon",
"...",
"Virgile Boon",
", captain of the 'Oiseau'.",
"Where can I find the harbor master?",
"Where can I find the captain of the 'Oiseau'?",
"Thank you. Goodbye.",
"He is usually at the port, overseeing the loading of goods. You'll need his permission before you can leave.",
"Thanks, ",
".",
"He'll be at the port, of course, getting the ship ready for departure.",
"Thanks, ",
".",
"Interesting. What's your offer?",
"I don't want the 'Oiseau' to reach #sOxbay#.",
"You want me to sink it?",
"Or capture it if you like; that's of no concern to me.",
"A pirate's life, eh? That might just suit me... And I'll start my career of plunder with you. \nI'll take 10000 gold for this job. In advance.",
"Yes, you'll make a pirate, right enough. Here's your money.",
"Damn you, ",
"! That's too rich for my blood!",
"I don't have that kind of money.",
"Thousand devils! This is a lucky day indeed! Thank you, ",
"!",
"One thing: Double-cross me, and you'll wish we'd never met.",
"You can trust me, friend! I, ",
", swear that ",
"Virgile Boon",
" will be fish food soon!",
"Bon chance, then. Good luck to you, ",
".",
"Anything else, ",
"?",
"Remember: We never spoke of this arrangement.",
"But of course, of course! I'm no fool, *slad*!",
"That's good to know. I'll be seeing you.",
