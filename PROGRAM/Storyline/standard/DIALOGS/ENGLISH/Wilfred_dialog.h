"Are you ",
"?",
"Yes...",
"I'm ",
". I've been waiting for you. I'm here to inform you where to make your landing.",
"There won't be any landing. The transport is resting on the seabed...",
"Ah, the governor mentioned there would be someone here to meet me. Would that be you?",
"I guess so, ",
". I was told to meet an English captain named ",
" and to show #spronoun2# where to land. \nOnce the location has been revealed, I'm to meet this captain on the shore of the landing site and lead #spronoun2# to a cave.",
"I'm curious - why can't the soldiers enter the cave from here?",
"Secrecy keeps the element of surprise on our side. The French have spies in #sGreenford#. If we head to the cave from here, the French will discover what we are up to. \nWe might get drawn into a battle, and if the French win, they might decide to take #sGreenford# as well.",
"Hmm...I guess you are right. So when and where can we put the soldiers ashore?",
"There is a deserted beach called Gray Rock Bay, ",
". It's the best place to do that.",
"How do we get there?",
"Head northwest when you sail out of the bay and then head south around the island. You'll see a huge gray rock separated from the island by the channel. \nThere is a big bay right behind the rock. Drop anchor there, ",
".",
"Are you going to wait for us there?",
"Yes, ",
". I'll wait for you on the beach every night. The landing should take place at night to avoid any French ships nearby. I'll signal with a torch to mark the landing site.",
"All right, one of these nights we'll put ashore.",
"Excellent, ",
". I'll wait for you there. Be careful. No one must learn of our plan.",
"Good luck, ",
".",
"You were supposed to escort it! Why did you let it sink?",
"We were outnumbered.",
"Oh, no! All is lost! What should we do now?",
"Sail on, I've work to do!",
"Anything else, ",
"? Have we discussed everything?",
"Yes, we're done. Farewell, ",
".",
"Oh no, ",
", this is terrible! The French must've noticed the light from my torch. This is awful!",
"What's the matter? What's wrong?",
"A French patrol is coming!",
"Well, I am always ready for a fight!",
"Excellent! What a fight! Are you sure that all the French soldiers are accounted for?",
"I didn't see any try to escape.",
"Good, because if the French learn about what has happened here, they'll start to comb the jungle. \nWhat if they find the cave? We'll have to fight.",
"I see you don't like to wave your sword very much.",
"I make no apologies, ",
". I am a craftsman, not a soldier. Now, let's not get distracted from our task.",
"So what's next?",
"When the soldiers are ashore, I'll lead them to the cave, ",
". There's no need for you to wander about the jungle with us. I know the way very well.",
"Great! I can't wait till I put to sea.",
"Have a good voyage, ",
". And fair winds.",
"Farewell.",
"I am glad to see you, captain! Where is the transport?",
"It sank on the way here...I did all I could...",
"No! All is lost! We need to get out of here, before the French come.",
"Wait...",
