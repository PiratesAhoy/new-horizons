"Good day, young #sgender#!",
"Good day. I'm told you know a lot about a ship called the 'Black Pearl.'",
"As a matter of fact, I do. I was lucky enough to serve on that fine ship. But that was many years ago, and it didn't end well. In fact, something happened during my time on the 'Black Pearl' that drove me from the sea\n and into the quiet life I live today.",
"What happened?",
"Well, the 'Black Pearl' was always a pirate ship. I won't deny that. Once upon a time, our crew had great luck. Our hold was always full of loot\nSo much gold, we spent it without a second thought. But among all those gold coins were some of the biggest and most beautiful you'd ever hope to see. Of course, we spent them, too, scarcely looking twice at them\nBut today I think there was a lot of blood on that gold. And a genuine curse.",
"...",
"One by one, it turned us against each other. Soon there were duels...and murder\nThe best of us were killed, and I and several others were left on an island to die. Somehow we survived, but others were condemned by the curse\nThey became the walking dead. You may well laugh, #slad#, but it's true! By day, they look like men, but the moonlight reveals their true nature. Living skeletons, they are! Neither bullet nor blade can kill them! They might pray for death. I think it's likely they do. But their sins and the curse won't let them leave this world.",
"I believe you. That was exactly who I met.",
"Then you're fortunate indeed to still be breathing. The only one way for these devils to rest in peace is to get those cursed coins back. That's nigh impossible now -- the coins will be spread throughout the archipelago.\n But nothing will stop these skeleton pirates from trying.\n And if you acquire any of this gold yourself, they will hound you until they lay their bony hands on it.",
"That's an incredible tale.",
"It's all true. I've seen hell, I tell you. And since then I've never once drawn a weapon. I've long been done with sailing and robbing\nI'm a pious man today. I go to church regularly. I read my Bible. And I advise you to do the same, #slad#!",
"Thanks for the advice. But I'm afraid it's too soon for me to lead a quiet life. Best of luck to you.",
