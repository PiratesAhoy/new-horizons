"Get out! I have no desire to talk with the likes of you!",
"...",
"What do you want from me? Can't you see that I am busy?",
"I have to talk to you, ",
".",
"You haven't met ",
"Ferro Cerezo",
" before, have you? Now is the time to correct that mistake.",
"You say your name is ",
"? You're the one I'm looking for!",
"Of course! Everyone wants a piece of me!",
"Don't be ridiculous. I'm here to take the papers you stole from the #sIsla Muelle# church.",
"Yes. I knew ",
"Padre Domingues",
" would be uneasy when he learned that proof of his money-lending had fallen into my hands.",
"If you've read those papers, then the nature of our friendly discussion will have to change.",
"If that's what those papers prove, then you should turn them over to the guard.",
"Let's do it this way: I'll buy the papers from you.",
"What do you mean?",
"You must have heard about me, I am ",
"Dear God! Of course I've heard of the most blood-thirsty rogue in these waters!",
"Shut up and give me the papers. I can put them to better use than you.",
"But...I was going to...",
"Did you say something?!",
"No, no! Nothing. Here, just take them!",
"Goodbye.",
"I don't doubt it. It's lucky I met you - my own ship isn't capable of a long voyage.\nIf you promise to deliver the papers to Europe, I'll give them to you gladly.",
"Agreed. Such misdeeds should be punished.",
"You could do that - for the low price of 10000 gold pieces.",
"How about 5000?",
"It's a deal.",
"No way. Don't waste any more of my time - I'm leaving soon.",
"You'll regret your foolishness!",
"Ah, you like to haggle? So do I! 9000.",
"6000.",
"Fine. Here's the money.",
"No way. Don't waste any more of my time - I'm leaving soon.",
"As you wish.",
"You're trying to rob me! 8000 is my final offer.",
"That's more than I care to spend.",
"All right. Here's your gold.",
"No way. Don't waste any more of my time - I'm leaving soon.",
"Fair enough.",
"Then get out of here and don't disturb me anymore! I need some rest before I sail.",
"Perhaps I'll see you again.",
"I hope you'll be able to profit from this bargain.",
"That's my business, not yours.",
"You know my name, do you? All right, lay it out for me. What do you need?",
"I need the papers you stole from the #sIsla Muelle# church.",
"So that old fox ",
"Padre Domingues",
" sent you.",
"Never mind who sent me. I want those papers.",
"Pretending for a moment that I know what you're talking about, why would I give them to you? Do you even know what's in those papers?",
"No. I only know that I need them.",
"So the old hypocrite didn't even tell his errand #sboy# how those papers discredit him? I knew he would be uneasy when he learned that proof of his money-lending had fallen into my hands.",
"If you know what those papers say, then I suppose the nature of our conversation will have to change.",
"Let's do it this way: I'll buy the papers from you.",
"What do you mean?",
"You must have heard about me, I'm ",
".",
"Oh, God! Of course I've heard of the most blood-thirsty mongrel in these waters!",
" I'll forgive you for calling me 'mongrel' once. Say it again, and you'll lose your tongue.",
"Forgive me! It just slipped out. Please - I didn't mean it!",
"Just shut up and give me the papers. I have an idea how to use them.",
"But...I was going to...",
"Did you say something?!",
"No, no! Nothing. Here, just take them!",
"Goodbye.",
"You could do that - for the low price of 10000 gold pieces.",
"How about 5000?",
"It's a deal.",
"This is robbery!",
"I'm not interested in that. You should go.",
"Well, since you realize the value of these papers, I suppose our conversation will have to take a new turn.",
"You'll regret this.",
"I doubt that. Look, if you don't want to pay, then be on your way.",
"Fine. But one day you'll wish you'd been more cooperative.",
"I like your style, buddy! How about 9000?",
"I think 6000 sounds better.",
"Okay. Here's your money.",
"No, that won't work. Now get out and let me be about my business. I set sail soon.",
"As you wish. But you'll regret this. Soon.",
"You're trying to rob me! 8000, and not a coin less.",
"No. That's too much for me.",
"Fine. Here's the money.",
"No, that won't do. Now get out and let me be about my business. I set sail soon.",
"Fair enough. I'll see you later, and perhaps I'll have the advantage.",
"Then get out of here and don't disturb me anymore! I need some rest before I sail.",
"You know, it's not wise to disappoint me.",
"Is that a threat?",
"It's a fact. If you don't want this to be the last day of your life, you'll hand over those papers.",
"Wait a minute. I recognize you now - you're the one who works for the English governor!",
"That's right. Now do you understand how serious I am?",
"I think I'll risk it. Now get out of my sight!",
"I warned you.",
"All right, all right! Take the papers - although I have no idea why your boss would want them. Take them and go.",
"Now we're talking!",
