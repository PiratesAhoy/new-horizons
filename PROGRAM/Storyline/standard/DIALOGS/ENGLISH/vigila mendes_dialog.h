"Wait, are you ",
"? Do you command the 'Juno'?",
"I'm sorry, but I'm going to set sail soon and I don't have time to talk to you.",
"In that case I don't dare to delay you. Safe travels.",
"Then you should hurry, before something... unexpected happens to you.",
"I'm glad to see you again, I'd like to talk with you about one thing.",
"I'm listening, what do you want to tell me?",
"I've heard that you are looking for a reliable captain who can escort your ship during your voyage.",
"I've heard you need an escort. I can do it for you.",
"Oh, I'm so glad to see you again! To tell you the truth I felt very safe under your protection! .",

"Are you satisfied with our cooperation?",
"Is that it? You don't need anything more from me? Then give me the coins.",

", you've probably heard of me.",
"Oh! I've heard about you! You're the captain that managed to escape from under the French squadron's very nose. The squadron that attacked #sOxbay#! Wow! I'd like to drink a mug of rum to that!",
"You flatter me. I'm glad to meet you too.",
"If I hadn't had urgent business in #sRedmond#, I would have given the French some powder to smell!",

"I'd like to ask you to do me a favor. Would you be so kind as to spare me a couple of minutes?",
"Yes, of course, what's the matter?",
"It's not been so serene around here recently. Piracy casts a pall over these waters and I'm a little worried because my ship is old and not as swift it once was. Also, I don't have enough cannons to manage a defence.",
"So, you want my ship to provide protection in the event of a pirate attack?",
"Yes, I really need an escort and I can pay you 2500 gold. For that your ship will escort me to #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# and back.",
"Agreed, when do we set sail?",
"Deal. When are you going to start the journey?",
"No. I'll lose more money on this voyage than I'll make.",
"No, it's not enough money to risk my ship.",

"Let's be on our way. May luck be with us.",
"What are you waiting for? Move it! I can't stay on this island forever.",
"Oh, yes! Thanks once again. Here is your reward\nToo bad that you've got your own ship. To be honest, I'd gladly hire you, because my navigator, ",

"It's always a pleasure to deal with you. I'll do it.",
"Sure, I'm going to do that.",
"I have to refuse. My crew won't work for free.",
"I said I'm not going to work for you, so find someone else.",
"That's too bad then, I'll have to take the risk and start the journey myself. Good luck.",
"Good luck to you too, senor.",
"Bye.",
"Yes, I really need an escort, but I would prefer to sail with less satellites, you know.",
"I'm sorry to hear that. But I intended to get rid of some of my ships, and afterwards I could escort you, if you're still interested.",
"Don't run away, fat man! I intended to get rid of some of the fools, they call themselves my companions, afterwards we make a deal!", //minor spell check by B. 'themself' in stead of 'temself'. Pieter please correct!
