"Please, leave me alone. I'm enjoying myself here!",
"I just...",
"Are you deaf? I said leave me alone. Leave now or I'll call for the soldiers to nail you to the tavern's door!",
"Hey!",
"What do you want?",
"My name is ",
".",
"I don't care what your name is. You're bothering me. Do you need something? If not, go away.",
"I... I want to work aboard a ship!",
"Do I look like a quartermaster?! Head to the dock and speak with the men there. I have nothing to do with common rabble. Now move along, I'm enjoying myself here!",
"No, wait! I'm not interested in becoming a deckhand. That's why I came to you, captain.",
"I see. Well, what position do you want?",
"Well, many have said I am an excellent navigator.",
"You don't say? Well, why didn't you say so? This is fortunate! My navigator was killed during the assault on #sOxbay#, and I've been seeking a replacement. \nAnd if you buy me a drink you're as good as hired!",
"(To the tavern-keeper)...Another round!",
"And the navigator must keep accurate charts of all our routes...",
"Excuse me, but may we discuss the details of the post later? For now maybe you can help me celebrate and tell me of your ship?",
"A grand idea! To your new job! Hiccup...more rum! Tomorrow morning go to the harbor and ask for the '",
"'.",
"So when are we putting to sea?",
"To sea? Ah...When that boat with the...hiccup...munitions comes. But you mind your tongue about that! No one is supposed to know about that ship!",
"Yes, certainly sir!",
"Now we're talking! Bring me one more mug of rum! Hiccup...All right, it's time to go to the ship...What a waste of a town, there's not a single brothel!",
"Sir! Let's have one more drink and...",
"And what? ...To your health, navigator! S-so, what did you...hiccup...want to say?",
"Just that I'll miss my aunt. She lives nearby, not far from the town wall...",
"I see. D-do you want to say good-bye to her...hiccup? You'll have to forget it! Escort me t-to the ship!",
"And I shall truly miss her daughters. They're sure to be such fine young women after all this time.",
"Wait. Er. Perhaps you should pay them a visit...Hiccup... Yes...hiccup...L-let's go right now!",
"Yes, sir!",
"Hiccup! Out of the way! My friend and...hiccup...I are going to pay a visit to the l-ladies!",
"...",
"What are you waiting for? L-let's go!",
"I'm coming!",
"W-wait. Where are we going? I see only jungle out here!",
"You're right. Let's stop here.",
"Why?",
"So you can tell me everything you know about the ship that carries those munitions.",
"What? You're no navigator, are you? You're an English spy!",
"You catch on fast.",
"...Outrageous! Deceiver! You'll learn nothing from me, and I'll make sure you tell no one. Prepare to fight, coward!",
"Captain contain yourself. You can barely stand, let alone fight.",
"...L-listen! You got me drunk on purpose!",
"Tell me everything and I'll spare you. Lie to me and I'll have to extract the information from you by other means.",
"...Oui, oui. I'll tell you. A barque, called 'Oiseau' is scheduled to bring fresh arms to this island, so we may secure the entire island. I heard that it is in #sFalaise de Fleur#'s harbor.\nThe captain of the Oiseau is waiting at the dock for his escort.",
"Will the barque remain in port until its escort arrives?",
"Oui. I believe so...That's all I know...",
"You've told me what I need to know. You may go.",
"Thank you for the information captain, now I'm afraid I have to kill you.",
