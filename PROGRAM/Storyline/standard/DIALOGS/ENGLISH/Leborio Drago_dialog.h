"You'd better cut the chatter and get to work, buddy. The guards are watching us - you want to get the lash?",
"You're right. I'll need my energy for the escape.",
"Sorry?",
"Nothing. Never mind.",
"Hey! You're awake, are you? Then start working! These slave-drivers don't like to see someone loafing.",
"How did I get here?",
"You didn't take long to scramble out of your hole, did you? Not so long ago, you were just a worker like me. Now you're a master.",
"I don't want to argue with you. I just need some answers.",
"You're back already? Did you manage to win my freedom?",
"Yes, you're free now. But I'd like you to answer a couple of my questions before you go.",
"What do you want? I told you everything I knew.",
"I promised to free you as soon as you answered all my questions, and I kept my word. You're free now.",
"Did you manage to win my freedom?",
"Not yet. I'm still working on that.",
"No, sorry. They asked too much money for you. I guess I'll have to find some other way to make you answer my questions.",
"Hello, captain. Did you decide to hire me?",
"That's why I'm here in this marsh. I'm glad you haven't found a job yet.",
"No. I'm on other business.",
"I heard you speaking with an officer. Are you really a captain?",
"None of your business.",
"It's time to go. Here, take your sword - and may God be with us!",
"Let's meet at the entrance.",
"We did it! Now we just need to get off the island.",
"Let's not stay here too long. Get aboard before they give chase!",
"Sorry, but I'm going it alone now. I don't need you.",
"Who are you, and why do you distract me from my work? You'd best be careful - these slave-drivers don't like that.",
"I need to ask you a question about some clay tablets that were found in these mines.",
"You want to know about that lad who was studying the tablets, don't you?",
"Yes, that's right.",
"Who are you?",
"Could you tell where they keep Indian tablets?",
"That lad copied the symbols from the tablets onto parchment. Then he sailed away. \nHe was talking about visiting #sIsla Muelle# to study the symbols in depth and translate them.",
"Thanks for the information.",
"Why should I answer your questions?",
"If you answer them to my satisfaction, I'll get you out of here.",
"Because if you don't, I'll order the soldiers to make you wish you had. Wouldn't you prefer a little conversation to a beating?",
"Ah, you scoundrel!",
"You want to fight, do you? I'm happy to oblige!",
"Let me put it this way: do you want to get out of here or not?",
"What? You can get me out?",
"This is a mine, not a prison. Escaping from here isn't a problem. The trick is getting off the island.",
"As it happens, my ship is anchored near the island - so that's not a problem, either.",
"Excellent! Can you fence?",
"What kind of captain would I be if I couldn't fence?",
"True enough. So here's the plan: a recent landslide buried scores of workers and four soldiers.",
"Did you manage to dig their weapons out?",
"Yes, we did. Now, listen - I can send messages from the jail. We'll need your ship to be waiting for us near the lighthouse.",
"Done. Get this letter to my officers. They'll be sure the ship is there.",
"We've got several hours before we can make our break. Get yourself some rest.",
"Wait! Have you heard anything about some earthen tablets with strange symbols on them? They'd be kept somewhere around here.",
"Are they what brought you here? Why is everyone so interested in them?",
"What do you mean by 'everyone'?",
"Another man came here a couple of months ago and made a copy of those tablets. And just a few days ago, a lady came asking after them, too.",
"Interesting...but you haven't answered my question. Are they still here?",
"What's left of them, yes. They were almost completely destroyed by the landslide.",
"Of all the rotten luck! What about the man who made parchment copies of them? Do you know where he went?",
"He said something about the Spanish colony. That's all I know.",
"All right. Get some rest and be ready to move when the time comes.",
"What do you want to know?",
"Don't take that tone with me. It's not my fault you're in these mines.",
"No, it's the fault of another pirate. A devil named ",
"Ethilrede Claar",
"Ethilrede Claar",
", who sank my ship and sold me as a slave.",
"So, you were a captain?",
"Well, you're not a captain now. You're a mine slave, and all I want from you are answers.",
"I was, yes. I commanded a merchant ship called 'Arethuse' until I wound up here.",
"Listen, let's make a deal. You answer my questions, and I'll get you out of here.",
"Fascinating. Now, you've wagged your tongue enough - answer my questions.",
"I have a better idea. You get me out of here, and then I'll answer your questions.",
"You've got a deal. Wait for me here.",
"What? Maybe you've forgotten who the slave is here. I'll lay down the terms. You can either answer my questions, or you can stay here in the mine.",
"Tough guy, are you?", 
"Now we're talking.",
"So, what are you interested in?",
"They say you helped a fellow who came here to study some clay tablets that were found in the mines.",
"Yeah, I did. A young fellow - he came in here, made parchment copies of the tablets, and left.",
"I don't suppose you know where he went.",
"Well, he said something about the Spanish colony.",
"Excellent. Maybe I have a shot at finding him.",
"Maybe you do, and maybe you don't.",
"What's that supposed to mean?",
"Well, just a few days ago, a sharp young lady was in here asking about the same young fellow. I told her everything she wanted to know - she was much prettier than you! So she may just find him first.",
"Well, we'll see about that.",
"Wait! Now that I'm a free man, I'd like to ask you a question for a change!",
"What is it?",
"I told you I was captain of a merchant ship, didn't I?",
"Let me guess - you'd like to join my crew?",
"That's about the size of it.",
"Not a bad idea. I'm always looking for sailors with a good head on their shoulders.",
"I don't think that's such a good idea.",
"Great! I'd be honored to sail under your flag.",
"Let's not rush things. There's your salary to discuss first.",
"I think 1500 gold should be fine.",
"That's not a bad salary for a former merchant captain. You've got a deal.",
"I don't think I can agree to these terms.",
"Fine, captain! Tell me the name of your vessel, and I'll meet you there.",
"All right. My ship is the '",
"'.",
"That's a pity. Well, I'll be looking for work at #sFalaise de Fleur# if you have a change of heart.",
"Fine. I'll keep that in mind.",
"I heard that slave-traders brought you here. They boasted that they smacked you on the head pretty hard.",
"What about my crew?",
"It seems they managed to escape capture.",
"Great. They'll be here to free me soon.",
"I wouldn't count on that.",
"Maybe you're right. I'll try and find a way to get myself out of here.",
"Then you don't know my crew. They'd do anything for me!",
"All right - get back to work! A guard is coming!",
"So? What's your point?",
"...",
"...",
"A man came here a couple of months ago and made a copy of those tablets. And just a few days ago, another man came asking after them, too.",
"Well, just a few days ago, a sharp young man was in here asking about the same fellow. I told him everything he wanted to know - he was much more persuasive than you! So he may just find the man who copied the tablets first.",
"Tough girl, are you?",
