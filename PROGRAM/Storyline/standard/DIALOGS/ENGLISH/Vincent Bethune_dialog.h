"Danielle",
" has spoken of me?",
"Yes, of course, ",
". My name, is ",
". You could say I'm old friends with ",
"Danielle",
".",
"You've arrived at last.",
"Have you located ",
"Raoul Rheims",
"?",
"I've heard that you both are looking for the same person. \nI happen to know where to find him.",
"You know where ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" is? How?",
"You could say we were neighbors at one time.",
"Can you lead us to him?",
"Absolutely. In a blink.",
"Excellent...",
"See that table near the door? That is ",
"Raoul Rheims",
". I suggest you talk to him, before he disappears... Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other matters I need to attend to.",
"Something tells me I wouldn't want to know what you're up to. Anyway, thanks for your help. Go on, we'll speak later.",
"I've heard about your relationship.",
"Some matters are best kept private. So, tell me, how did you find ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" and why did you decide to help us.",
"Well, to be precise, I'm not interested in helping you. I'm helping only ",
"Danielle",
" in this matter.",
"I see. But I'm still curious about Rheims, how did you find him?",
"As you say, ",
".",
"Please. Enough with the familiarities. I don't know if you can be trusted.",
"Danielle",
" was right about you - you're far too suspicious.",
"What ",
"Danielle",
" thinks or says is #spronoun3# own business. But I really must know how you know the man we're looking for and why you decided to help ",
"Danielle",
", or I'll hurt you!",
"All right, all right, calm down. I know ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" very well - we were, if I can say so, neighbors once. As for ",
"Danielle",
", I've decided to help #spronoun2# because #spronoun# once helped me out in a very unpleasant situation.",
"Convincing. I'll check that. So where did you say ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" is hiding?",
"I didn't say. You should talk with ",
"Danielle",
", first - maybe #spronoun# doesn't want you to come with us.",
"All right, I'll speak with #spronoun2#.",
