title=Side Quest - Nigel Blythe.
text.t1=In #sQuebradas Costillas# on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# I saw two men fighting in the street. It's my principle not to interfere in such matters, but it's a funny thing. After one fellow was killed, the other told me a strange story about how he lost his ship.
text.t2=I think that such a headstrong fellow might complement my crew well. I made him my officer but should make sure to increase his defensive abilities and fighting skill.
text.t3=This fellow offered his services as an officer, but I have my reservations about him, so I told him I have a full crew.
text.t4=When I arrived in #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#, I found that Nigel had left my ship. Maybe he is in town.
text.t5=The fellow's tricks made me get rid of him.
text.t6=The fellow didn't waste any time. He sought out a contract to deliver a cargo of chocolate. Unfortunately, the contract was not to my liking, so I had to turn it down.
text.t7=The fellow didn't waste any time. He sought out a contract to deliver a cargo of chocolate. Now I'm to deliver this chocolate to #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle#, to Emiliano Rionda's store.
text.t8=I forgot all about the chocolate cargo. Now even if I reach Emiliano, I suspect the delivery will be too late.
text.t9=I delivered Emiliano Rionda's cargo. It was not very profitable.
text.t10=When I came to #sConceicao# on #sisland_Conceicao#, I found Nigel had already gone. I suspect he is off hatching some scheme again.
text.t11=I knew it! The rascal has accepted 10000 gold to kill Mean Harry within a month. It's quite a risky proposition...but I think I can do it.
text.t12=I knew it! The rascal has accepted 10000 gold to kill Mean Harry within a month. But when I found out that Garry has at least a corvette or even a frigate, I refused the agreement.
text.t13=A month has gone, and I still can't find Harry. But I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. And I've no plans to return any of the gold.
text.t14=Mean Harry was not so hard to deal with. Now I've got to go look for a reward. They say that the island's governor will give it to me.
text.t15=It's an outrage! Why should I pay taxes? Devils and dogs! Unfortunately the governor has a strong argument on his side - his fleet. But taxes...4000 gold? Argh!
text.t16=As soon as I made Nigel captain of one of my ships, he attacked a ship near #sisland_Douwesen#! And it was a smuggler's ship to boot! Damn!
text.t17=A smuggler ship sank Nigel. No wonder. But never mind Nigel... it's the loss of my ship that troubles me.
text.t18=I helped Nigel defeat a smuggler. I should ask Nigel what's going on...
text.t19=The smuggler's friends were waiting for us. I didn't listen to a word they said... I just killed them.
text.t20=The smuggler's friends were waiting for us. They killed Nigel, and I escaped while they were busy kicking his corpse. Can't blame them - he was a real bastard.
text.t21=That rascal Nigel! He stole my ship! Devils! Late at night he sailed away. Perhaps he is on #sisland_Isla Muelle#... that island was nearby.
text.t22=The scoundrel is on #sisland_Isla Muelle#! They saw him in the #sIsla Muelle# tavern!
text.t23=The tavern owner said that Nigel was here, and he talked with a fellow called Caminero who lives in a house at the back of the tavern.
text.t24=Caminero said that Nigel is going to join his old crew on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#. Interesting... what this fellow up to?
text.t25=I've met a sailor from Nigel's ship in the tavern of #sQuebradas Costillas# on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#. He told me that the rascal left the island, but he doesn't know where he is going. Maybe Clauss, Nigel's boatswain, knows. He is now in #sQuebradas Costillas# store, working off his debts.
text.t26=The best way to solve this problem is with a little gold. I just paid the debt of Clauss - Nigel's boatswain. Now for a private talk. He's in the tavern.
text.t27=Clauss said Nigel left the island to join his old crew in #sDouwesen# on #sisland_Douwesen#. The way to his sunken ship full of silver is under a waterfall on #sisland_Douwesen#.
text.t28=I arrived just in time. Nigel was astonished to see me. I killed him and took all the silver from the ship.
text.t29=I knew it! The rascal has accepted 10000 gold to kill Mean Harry within a month. But when I found out that Garry has at least a a fluyt or even a galleon, I refused the agreement.
