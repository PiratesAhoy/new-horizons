title=Silver for Cartagena
text.t1=#sname# told me something very interesting. The silver train, carrying silver from Spain's colonies on the mainland, is on its way to #sCartagena#. I should make my own way there to find out more. Perhaps ask at the taverns - discreetly, of course.
text.t2=#sname#, the waitress in the tavern in #sCartagena# town centre, is willing to set up a deal. A local Indian village is suffering from a disease and can not afford to buy medicine. In exchange for 100 crates of medicine, they will help me find a way to ambush the silver train. When I have the medicine, I should tell #sfirstname# that she would look better in a blue dress. This will tell her, without alerting suspicion to anyone overhearing, that I am ready to proceed with the deal.
text.t3=#sname# will need a couple of days to make the arrangements. Then I should take the medicine to Dolphin Sands, the beach near #sCartagena#, where the Indians will meet me.
text.t4=The medicine is unloaded. One of the Indians will lead me to where I can ambush the silver train.
text.t5=I'm not sure I fully trust the Indians. I'll give them their medicine after I have ambushed the silver train.
text.t6=I do not have the full load of medicine, so I bluffed the Indians. I told them that they would have to lead me to the silver train before they get the medicine. They fell for it.
text.t7=Ouch! The Indian led me into a swamp, where something bit me!
text.t8=Apparently I was bitten by a particularly venomous snake. The Indians have been able to cure the poison by combining the medicine I brought them with some of their own stuff.
text.t9=Apparently I was bitten by a particularly venomous snake. The Indians have been able to cure the poison by combining the medicine I brought them with some of their own stuff. I didn't have quite as much as they wanted so I gave them some money to buy the rest.
text.t10=Apparently I was bitten by a particularly venomous snake. The Indians have been able to cure the poison by combining the medicine I brought them with some of their own stuff. I didn't have as much as they wanted. They were kind enough to use some of it for my cure anyway, but they will not help me with the silver train.
text.t11=The Indian guide has led me to a place which is hidden from view from the main road into town. This will be perfect to ambush the silver train. Also, because I gave the village a load of medicine, they will continue to welcome me. The path to the village is marked by a small totem.
text.t12=The silver train was well guarded and it was a tough fight! Now to lead the mules to the beach so that the silver can be loaded onto the ship.
text.t13=The silver train was too well guarded. I escaped, but without any silver.
text.t14=Ambush! Another Spanish force showed up on the way back to the beach. They have been defeated and I can continue to the beach.
text.t15=Ambush! Another Spanish force showed up on the way back to the beach. I had to abandon the mules and the silver.
text.t16=The silver is loaded onto the ship. It should fetch a pretty penny when I sell it! For preference, I should find a colony which imports silver as the price will be better.
text.t17=I can see a Spanish ship near the beach, and there may be more nearby. We will need to fight our way out to open sea.
text.t18=I should not have tried to deceive #sfirstname#. The deal is off. And I probably will not be very welcome in the tavern any more...
text.t19=Apparently the silver train is on its way to #sCartagena#. But it is sure to be well guarded and I don't feel confident enough to try to take it. Perhaps next year...
text.t20=Apparently the silver train is on its way to #sCartagena#. But if I attack it, I will make an enemy of Spain. I don't want to do that.
text.t21=I didn't have enough medicine when I met the Indians. The deal is off. So I will not be able to attack the silver train.
