title=General Quest - Smuggling on #sisland#.
text.t1=I talked to a smuggler in the tavern. He said he could help me sell my cargo, but said I might want to find out first how to avoid the coastguard patrols. Then talk to him again.
text.t2=I found a guard who was off duty. After paying him some money, he told me the best time would be #stime#. I may need to wait for that by talking to one of my crew on deck.
text.t3=I found a guard who believed my story about how I wanted to have a nice seaside picknick. I should go to the location #stime#. I may need to wait for that by talking to one of my crew on deck.
text.t4=I didn't show up as I promised I would, so the deal is off.
text.t5=I made the deal with the smugglers and made a nice profit!
text.t6=Alas! The coastguard found me, I have to fight my way out of this it seems.
text.t7=It seems the smugglers weren't too happy with me and they tried to kill me.
text.t8=I cancelled the deal with the smugglers. Altough they didn't seem happy, they did let me go.
text.t9=I tricked the smugglers. I took their money, but kept the goods myself!
text.t10=I'm confident I know when it's safe, so the smuggler told me I should go to #slocation#. 
text.t11=I asked on of my officers to go to #slocation# and watch when the guards come and go. He should be back tomorrow. I could wait here or do something in the meantime.
text.t12=I found a guard who was off duty and he wanted to play a game of cards. After beating him he told me the best time to go is #stime#. I may need to wait for that by talking to one of my crew on deck.
text.t13=My officer came back and told me #stime# is the best time to do some smuggling. I may need to wait for that by talking to one of my crew on deck.
text.t14=I guess my officer was caught or something because he didn't show up.
text.t15=This smuggling business sounds too risky for me, so I cancelled the deal. I hope the smugglers will forgive me in case I ever care to try again.
