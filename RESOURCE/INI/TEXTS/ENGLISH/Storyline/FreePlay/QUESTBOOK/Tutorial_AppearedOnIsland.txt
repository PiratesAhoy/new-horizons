text.t3=Having succeeded in taking control of the ship from the Captain, may he rot, we have arrived at the #sisland# on Nevis, on the far-side of the island from Charlestown. I will be letting off anyone who doesn't wish to sail with me. I chose this path, they did not. Most of them have families back home they'll want to see again and many are still loyal to the crown however they were treated. No accounting for taste I guess...
