title=Arrival
text.t1=After a long trip from Bordeaux I finally arrived in #sHavana#, and I saw this beautiful lady. Mon Dieu, she was very eager to get to know me. Sadly, her brother found us and challenged me to a duel. So here I am, waiting on some beach to kill the Don.
text.t2=As soon as I had killed Villalobos, a whole patrol of Spanish soldiers turned up to arrest me. For murder! I don't even know if I really killed him. He seemed dead. Anyway, after I was sent to jail. The jailkeeper set me free, if I gave him #smoney# gold pieces. Which only left me 1. The bastard! And after that I also had to fight the prisonguards. I am a fugitive now, if they catch me again, they will hang me immediatly. I have to find my crew. But first, get out of this damn city!
text.t3=Well, there is no way I can get my own ship back. Since it lies heavily guarded in port. So I need to steal another one. Gerard told me there was an English smuggler moored at Bahia de San Antiono, it is the nearest bay. Straight as we go.
text.t4=Ha! The "Seahorse" is ours. I think it would be best if I'd set course to the nearest safe port: #sPort au Prince#.
text.t5=I am now the proud owner of a Spanish Galleon! Stole it from right under their noses, now that is daring! I should leave Cuba before the Spanish notice that I took a Galleon from their priests. It would be best if I set course to #sPort au Prince#.

text.t9=Finally that idiot of a captain got us to #sisland_Cuba#. I challenged him to a game of cards for the ship. When I won, he accused me of cheating. He'll pay for that with his life!
