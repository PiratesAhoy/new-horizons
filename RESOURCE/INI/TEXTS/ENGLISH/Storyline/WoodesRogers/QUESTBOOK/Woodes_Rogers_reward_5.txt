title=Woodes Rogers fifth reward
text.t1=There is a Key in the molasses tank. I have to get it out of there somehow. Rogers mentioned the Shop Office - I have to pass through it.
text.t2=Where do these pistols come from? Who have they belonged to - pirates accepting amnesty from Woodes Rogers? This very long weapon has the signature 'Richards'. I guess it's time again to enter Rogers' large residence...
