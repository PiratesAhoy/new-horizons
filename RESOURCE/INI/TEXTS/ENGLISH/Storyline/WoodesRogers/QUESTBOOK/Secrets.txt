text.t1=The Officers have stolen a copy of a Map. The original is still around here somewhere (YES!). I'll search this room carefully!
text.t2=I have found a Gold Key, maybe to 'Stephenson's Chest'?
text.t3=No this wasn't the Chest but it's easy enough to guess where these Levers should be placed.
text.t4=Aha, there's a Secret room - now I only have to figure out what these levers do...
text.t5=There's an Oilcloth Package in the Chest. I'll need something to cut it open with.
text.t6=A Notebook and a Sealed Paper! I must be very careful with the knife when opening the seals.
text.t7=It's only a piece of a larger Caribbean Map. Is that all?
text.t8=It's time to go downstairs and visit Caroline in her Drawing Room.
