title=Imperial Escort
text.t1=#sadmiral# has persuaded me to go to #sIsla Muelle#. There I am to rendezvous with #scaptain#, captain of the '#sship#'. It sounds like a simple job but the money is good. Apparently #sgovernor# himself recommended me.
text.t2=I have met the captain of the '#sship#', #scaptain#, along with the passenger. She is no less a person than #senvoy#, daughter of Emperor Leopold of the Holy Roman Empire. My first task is to help #scaptain# ensure that she reaches #sIsla Muelle# town hall safely.
text.t3=That was easy enough. #senvoy# has been to the town hall and is back on board the '#sship#'. We are to sail to #sSanto Domingo#, where I will again escort her to the town hall.
text.t4=On the way to #sSanto Domingo# we were attacked by French ships. The '#sship#' was sunk. Given the importance of the passenger, I'm probably out of favour with Spain, to put it mildly.
text.t5=On the way to #sSanto Domingo# we were attacked by French ships. We defeated the attackers and can continue to #sSanto Domingo#.
text.t6=We were attacked in #sSanto Domingo#! While #scaptain# and I were fending off a group attacking from the front, someone snuck up behind and made off with #senvoy#. We have no choice but to report this to #sadmiral# in #sHavana#.
text.t7=We were attacked in #sSanto Domingo#! A group attacked us from the front but it was just a diversion. Someone tried to sneak up behind and grab #senvoy#, but we managed to see him off.
text.t8=The '#sship#' is no longer in port. She must have already left for #sHavana#. I shall sail there as well and hopefully catch up with her.
text.t9=I should never have got involved in this. The '#sship#' never arrived in #sHavana#. She's disappeared, and #senvoy# with her. #sadmiral# actually thinks I kidnapped the Electress!
text.t10=I should never have got involved in this.  #sadmiral# actually thinks I kidnapped #senvoy#!
text.t11=#srescuer# has broken me out of jail by giving the guards brandy laced with something. Because he recommended me, #sgovernor# is also under suspicion. #srescuer1# thinks the only way the governor's name will be cleared is if I find out who really took #senvoy#, incidentally clearing my own name in the process. I'm going to try my luck at #sTortuga#. Perhaps someone there knows who really kidnapped her.
text.t12=#spirate# says no pirate took #senvoy#. In fact, he thought I did it, until I set him straight. If the pirates didn't do it, perhaps the French did, so I'll see if the governor of #sTortuga# knows anything - he works for France, at least officially.
text.t13=The local governor has no idea what the French are doing, so I'll see if the governor of #sPort au Prince# knows anything.
text.t14=The local governor has no idea what the French are doing, so I'll see if the governor of #sPort au Prince# knows anything. But first I'll need a disguise because if the governor of #sPort au Prince# recognises me, I'll probably end up back in jail. The local tailor should be able to provide something suitable.
text.t15=I barely got out of #sPort au Prince# town hall alive! Outside I was ambushed by #sagent# and his men. Once all his lackeys were dead, he surrendered and told a very interesting story. This whole thing was set up by #sevilgov# to discredit #sgovernor#. I just happened to be useful because of my connection with the governor. It was #sagent# who took #senvoy#, claiming to work for me. The plan was for #sevilgov# to 'rescue' her. She's being held at Peninsula de Zapata. The only way I'm going to clear my name is if I'm the one doing the rescuing, so I'd better get to #sisland_Cuba# quickly!
text.t16=My French uniform fooled the governor of #sPort au Prince# but she didn't know anything useful. But outside I was ambushed by #sagent# and his men. Once all his lackeys were dead, he surrendered and told a very interesting story. This whole thing was set up by #sevilgov# to discredit #sgovernor#. I just happened to be useful because of my connection with the governor. It was #sagent# who took #senvoy#, claiming to work for me. The plan was for #sevilgov# to 'rescue' her. She's being held at Peninsula de Zapata. The only way I'm going to clear my name is if I'm the one doing the rescuing, so I'd better get to #sisland_Cuba# quickly!
text.t17=My disguise worked. #sPoPgovernor#, governor of #sPort au Prince#, wants me to sneak a spy into #sIsla Muelle#. If I do that, perhaps I'll gain enough of her trust that I can get her to say something useful about the abduction of #senvoy#.
text.t18=The spy, #sspy#, wants to take the place of a dock worker in #sIsla Muelle# named #sdocker#. If I can persuade the dock worker to board my ship, #sspy# can simply walk off and pretend to be him.
text.t19=#sdocker# is safely tied up in my hold. #sspy# is ashore. Even I can't tell the difference and #sspy# has been aboard my ship since we left #sPort au Prince#! Now to return to #sPort au Prince# and speak to the governor again. The code phrase I must use is 'The albatross is in his nest'.
text.t20=#sdocker# is safely tied up in my hold. #sspy# is ashore. Even I can't tell the difference and #sspy# has been aboard my ship since we left #sPort au Prince#! Now to return to #sPort au Prince# and speak to the governor again. The code phrase I must use is 'The albatross is in his nest'. I must also remember to use my disguise again.
text.t21=#sPoPgovernor# does not know who abducted #senvoy#. All she knows is that it wasn't me, and that the '#sship#' was last seen heading for #sisland_Cuba#. The abductors won't want the '#sship#' to be seen in a port so I'll need to see if she is hiding at one of the beaches.
text.t22=#sPoPgovernor# does not know who abducted #senvoy#. All she knows is that it wasn't me, and that the ship which took the envoy was last seen heading for #sisland_Cuba#. The abductors won't want the ship to be seen in a port so I'll need to see if she is hiding at one of the beaches.
text.t23=Off Peninsula de Zapata I found and defeated the '#sship#'. #senvoy# wasn't aboard so she may be held captive somewhere nearby. I should search the beach and the surrounding area.
text.t24=Off Peninsula de Zapata I found a ship which didn't seem to want to be found. If its crew were responsible for the kidnap of #senvoy#, she may be held captive somewhere nearby. I should search the beach and the surrounding area.
text.t25=#senvoy# was being held in a cave by #sagent# and his men. I threw an ether bottle into the cave which stunned everyone except #sagent#, so I had to negotiate with him. In exchange for agreeing to take him to #sTortuga#, he released the Electress to me.
text.t26=#senvoy# was being held in a cave by #sagent# and his men. I threw an ether bottle into the cave which stunned everyone except #sagent#, so I had to negotiate with him. In exchange for hiring him as an officer, he released the Electress to me.
text.t27=#senvoy# was being held in a cave. I threw an ether bottle into the cave which stunned everyone, including the Electress. She might be upset about that later, but at least I can get her out of the cave safely.
text.t28=#senvoy# recovered outside the cave.  She is not sure whether to trust me as #sagent# told her that he worked for me, but hopefully she'll realise the truth by the time I take her to #sHavana#. And then there's the matter of #sevilgov# - the whole plot was his idea to discredit #sgovernor# and take his job. So I should find him in #sSantiago# town hall. Or perhaps I should take #senvoy# to #sHavana# and try to clear my name first.
text.t29=I kept my word and delivered #sagent# to #sTortuga#.
text.t30=#sromance# has been killed. I doubt that the trader in #sHavana# port will sell me a bottle of ether and there isn't time to try to find one somewhere else. I'll just have to return to the cave and try to rescue #senvoy# some other way.
text.t31=#sromance# thinks throwing an ether bottle into the cave to subdue the kidnappers would be the best way to rescue #senvoy#, and I agree. Unfortunately I don't have one. The trader in #sHavana# port knows #sromance# and might sell an ether bottle to #spronoun2#, so we'll go there.
text.t32=#sromance# bought an ether bottle for me. Now to return to the cave!
text.t33=#senvoy# is dead. Spain will never forgive me for this! I had better stay clear of all Spanish ports from now on.
text.t34=If I am to rescue #senvoy# from her abductors, I should be prepared. If they're in a room or cave then a bottle of ether may prove useful. And I'll want an officer with me, I don't want to face the gang alone.

text.t37=#senvoy# was being held in a cave by #sagent# and his men. I had to negotiate with him. In exchange for hiring him as an officer, he released the Electress to me.
text.t38=#senvoy# was being held in a cave by #sagent# and his men. After a battle in the cave, I was able to rescue her.
text.t39=#senvoy# was being held in a cave by #sagent# and his men. I tried to rescue her by fighting her abductors, but unfortunately she was killed.
text.t40=#senvoy# was being held in a cave. Without their leader, #sagent#, it was easy to persuade them to surrender and release her to me.
text.t41=#senvoy# is not sure whether to trust me as #sagent# told her that he worked for me, but hopefully she'll realise the truth by the time I take her to #sHavana#. And then there's the matter of #sevilgov# - the whole plot was his idea to discredit #sgovernor# and take his job. So I should find him in #sSantiago# town hall. Or perhaps I should take the Electress to #sHavana# and try to clear my name first.
text.t42=When we arrived in #sSantiago#, a squad of soldiers tried to arrest me. #senvoy# sent them away - it's useful having someone like that on your side! Now to deal with #sevilgov#.
text.t43=#sevilgov# is dead. Now I must take #senvoy# to #sHavana# if I am to have any chance of clearing my name.
text.t44=My good name with Spain is restored. #senvoy# is safe and will soon be on her way home.
text.t45=Between the ships I had before all this, and the ships I have now, I have too many ships! If I want my old fleet back, I'll need to sell or berth some of my current fleet.
text.t46=Between the ships I had before all this, and the ships I have now, I have too many ships! If I want my old fleet back, I'll need to sell or berth my entire current fleet.
text.t47=#sadmiral# has given me the privilege of leading the squad to arrest #sevilgov#. If he resists arrest, I shall have my revenge on him, so I hope he resists. #sSantiago# town hall awaits!
text.t48=#sevilgov# is dead. I should report this to #sadmiral#.
text.t49=With #sevilgov# dead and discredited, #sgovernor# can be restored as governor of #sSantiago#.
text.t50=#sgovernor# has written to #sadmiral# recommending me for some sort of mission. I should go to the admiralty in #sHavana# to find out more.
text.t51=#senvoy# will rest for a day, then visit the governor of #sSanto Domingo#. We should be ready to sail on #sday#.
text.t52=It's time to go to the port. Don't want to keep Capitán #scaptain# waiting, do we?
