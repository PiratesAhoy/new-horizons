title=Payroll Ship
text.t1=The commandant of #sHavana# prison had a letter asking him to provide security troops for a ship carrying a payroll from #sHavana# to #sSantiago#. I'll need to find out more about this ship if I'm to help myself to that payroll...
text.t2=Now to head for the tavern. If the payroll ship's captain is there, perhaps he will tell me about it if he thinks I'm one of the commandant's security troops.
text.t3=Now to head for the tavern. If the payroll ship's captain is there, perhaps he will yield to my feminine wiles.
text.t4=The ship is the 'Siroco'. She sails for #sSantiago# in two weeks. So that is how long I have to get to #sSantiago# and find a suitable ship to attack her.
text.t5=Playa de Sierra Maestra is near #sSantiago# so from there I should be able to intercept the 'Siroco' whichever route she takes around #sisland_Cuba#.
text.t6=We've got a nice little brig. But if the payroll ship has a security force aboard, I had better bring my own ship's crew up to full strength. #sRedmond# isn't too far away, perhaps we can get some recruits there.
text.t7=The 'Siroco' has probably sailed by now. We had better sail to Playa de Sierra Maestra and keep watch for her.
text.t8=Too late. The payroll ship will undoubtedly be safely in #sSantiago# harbour by now.
text.t9=We've done it! The 'Siroco' is taken, and so is the payroll. We are back in business! But #sSantiago# fort will recognise this ship, so if I want to return to #sSantiago# then I'd best moor at Bahia de Moa and walk in. Or get a different ship.
text.t10=The 'Siroco' has probably sailed by now. I really need a map of #sisland_Cuba#'s waters. The store in #sSantiago# must have one; if he won't sell it to me, I'll get it some other way.
