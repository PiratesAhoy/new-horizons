title=Marriage
text.t1=I have proposed marriage to #sromance#. This is almost as worrying as taking on a frigate!
text.t2=#sromance# is too demanding. I should have known that marriage and a free sea life do not mix well.
text.t3=I may be in with a chance here. But #sromance# is a patriot and will not love me while Spain hates me. Should I beg forgiveness from some Spanish governor or forget the whole thing?
text.t4=#sromance# is unsure of my true intentions. Perhaps a nice piece of jewellery will win her heart.
text.t5=#sromance# is unsure of my true intentions. Perhaps one of the swords I captured would make a suitable gift, though it will need to be polished to highest standard.
text.t6=Now we're getting somewhere! #sromance# is interested in me, but a wedding will need a wedding ring.
text.t7=Yes! The marriage is on - provided #sromance#'s father, the governor of Santiago, approves.
text.t8=The governor wants a lot of money. And I have to give up being a pirate. But a Letter of Marque will allow me to raid French ships legally.
text.t9=This is too much! The governor wants me to pay to marry #sromance#! To the devil with that - I could practically buy a ship for that much!
text.10=Well, I've paid what the governor wants. Now I need to wait in the tavern while he makes the preparations.
text.t11=And it's done. I'm hitched. Now back to the governor's residence for the reception, while the crew are off to the tavern.
text.t12=My first married night is over. I should be polite and talk to the governor again before I leave.
text.t13=Someone has shot #sromance#, right in the governor's house! The shot was fired from outside, through the window.
text.t14=I need to go and find the assassin. First I should find a witness who saw the shot being fired.
text.t15=The assassin is disguised as a soldier. But he's not carrying a musket. That should help me to identify him from all the real soldiers.
text.t16=The assassin was carrying a ring from #svillain#. So #svillain# probably hired him.
text.t17=#sromance# has made a full recovery, thank goodness! Now to hit back at #svillain#...
text.t18=As part of the reward for defeating the French, #sgovernor# has suggested that I marry #sromance#, who is very much in favour of the idea. I have accepted.
text.t19=Now I need to wait in the tavern while #sgovernor# makes the preparations for the wedding.
