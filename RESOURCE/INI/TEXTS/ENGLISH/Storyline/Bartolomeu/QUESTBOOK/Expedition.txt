title=My first expedition
text.t1=That's a strange woman I met. This French corsair has a blasted character! But she's very smart. She could be the perfect partner for my first expedition. I also met and hired an experienced pirate... at least that's what he said. Now, I just need to go to #sisland_Redmond#, land at Rocky Shore to pick up some pirates, then sail to #sisland_Cuba# and land at Playa de Maestra. I hope everything will be fine. 
text.t2=I can't believe in that! Pedro Rivera compromised the mission! He is a danger to us all. Fortunately, he won't be my problem anymore. At least, I hope I never see him again... and that the sale of the cacao at #sRedmond# will be sufficiently lucrative.
text.t3=30 000 gold coins is rather good for my first expedition... If I don't think that could be better! Anyway, I've had the opportunity to meet a good captain. Now, it's time to work alone and this reward Roxanne spoke of gives me the opportunity! I just need to talk to the Governor of #sisland_Conceicao#.
text.t4=I spent too much time getting to #sisland_Cuba#. The galleon has left #sSantiago# with the cargo. The expedition is finished - what a waste.
