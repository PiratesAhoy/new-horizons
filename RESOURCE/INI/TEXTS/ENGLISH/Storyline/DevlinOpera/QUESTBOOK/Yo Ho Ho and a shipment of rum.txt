title=Yo Ho Ho and a shipment of rum
text.t1=Here we are with a shipload of rum, that we need to deliver to an high-ranking officer on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur# for his son's wedding. We also need to explain why part of it got 'lost' on the way...
text.t2=I need to find the officer who ordered the rum. They say he's always visiting the governor this time of the day.
text.t3=Toni Haraldo asked me to return his poetry book from a guard named Guzman. But first I need to find the head guard Crespo.
text.t4=Crespo says Guzman is on duty at the jungle gates.
text.t5=The Frenchman Guzman sold the book to lives in a small house with three boxes near the door.
text.t6=Too late again! The Frenchman sold the book to a carpenter at the repair dock...
text.t7=...and the carpenter gave it away too. Bonto lives near the well in the slums.
text.t8=Bonto donated the book to the church!
text.t9=The priest said I can find the widow near the well by the store.
text.t10=Now I need to find this swimmer at the beach.
text.t11=I guess it's back to Haraldo then!
