title=Down and out in??
text.t1.p1=I shouldn't have left port while the storm was still raging. Though we escaped the fleet we had sighted before, the storm proved to be more dangerous than the Royal Navy: we had to ride it out for several days, and it was quite impossible to steer against it or even to determine our position. Finally the ship ran aground on some sandbank, and I was washed ashore. Now I must find my ship, which must be somewhere around this island.
text.t1.p2=Then I must take stock of my situation and decide how to get out of it: is our ship still sound enough to sail or should I repair it first? Can I do that with my own means or do I sneak into some (possibly hostile) town? Do I have enough men to capture ships or must I earn my living by thievery or swordfighting? Smugglers and highwaymen may help me out of my dilemma; I should try to talk with them.
