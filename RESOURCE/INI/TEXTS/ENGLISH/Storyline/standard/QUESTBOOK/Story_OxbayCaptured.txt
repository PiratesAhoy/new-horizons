title=Inform the governor about the French attack.
text.t1=Malcolm was right about spotting French near #sisland_Oxbay#. A war fleet is upon #sOxbay# port! I had better get away before I am detected and destroyed with the rest of the English here.
text.t2=A French squadron captured the English colony, #sOxbay# on #sisland_Oxbay#. The French succeeded because the fort's defences were so weak. I escaped only by great good fortune. I suppose I should inform the governor of the main English colony - #sRedmond# on the island #sisland_Redmond#, Sir Robert Christopher Silehard, about the attack, so he can take appropriate measures. By chance, I noticed someone else also managed to escape the French. I saw a ship sailing away from the bay. I wonder who the captain was.
