title=Wait for new orders from Silehard.
text.t1=Silehard ordered me to participate in the liberation of #sOxbay# on #sisland_Oxbay#. Unfortunately, I have little choice; all the city's entrances are blocked. The only thing I can do is await his orders in the tavern.
text.t2=What the devil! The English soldiers attacked #sDanielle# and me! #sDanielle#, of course, disappeared immediately after the fight - I suppose #spronoun# is hiding something from me. Poor #skid#, #spronoun# nearly went berserk - #spronoun3# boatswain Ralph was killed. That's unfortunate; Ralph was a good man. In any case, I need to figure out what's going on here.
text.t3=I should have listened to #sDanielle# and gotten out of that tavern. As soon as #sDanielle# left, the soldiers entered the tavern and told me to lay down my arms. There were four of them, so the odds were in their favour and I was forced to yield. What the devil is going on?
