title=Find the traitor named Raoul Rheims.
text.t1=The governor gave me a new mission. I was told to find a certain Rheims who deserted to the French side while carrying out an important mission for the governor. It is known that Rheims' ship has called at the pirate settlement on the island of #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#. I should sail there, and if Rheims is not there, I'll proceed according to the circumstances. In any case, I'm to find him and bring him to the governor.
text.t2=The tavern-keeper, Ines Diaz, told me that Rheims sailed to #sConceicao# on #sisland_Conceicao# where he has some businesses with Desmond Ray Beltrop, the leader of the smugglers. According to her, the day before Rheims left, someone tried to shoot him. Perhaps Silehard has sent someone else to kill Rheims?
text.t3=The tavern-keeper Ines Diaz refused to talk to me. I'll have to find some other source of information.
text.t4=I found out that Rheims has set out for #sisland_Conceicao# where he plans to meet with the leader of the smugglers, Desmond Ray Beltrop.
text.t5=One fellow I met in the street of the pirate settlement on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# told me that he knows where Rheims is. He asked 1500 gold for the information, and I refused to pay him. However, now it appears I have no choice but to pay to that dirty pirate 1500 gold. Otherwise I'll have to sail to every island in the archipelago trying to track down Rheims myself.
text.t6=I tried to ask the tavern-keeper in #sConceicao# on #sisland_Conceicao# about Rheims, but the fellow was frightened when I mentioned the name of the smuggler leader.
text.t7=Finally I got lucky! Beltrop's messenger was waiting for me by the tavern's entrance. Unfortunately, I didn't get the information I needed from my conversation with the smuggler leader. Rheims sailed away several days ago and Beltrop posted some guards by his house. It appears I have no other choice but to sneak into Rheims's house - even though that's just what Beltrop told me not to do. It's best to wait until nightfall. I am going to rent a room in the tavern in order to have a place to wait.
text.t8=Night has fallen. Now it's time to sneak into to Rheims's house. The guards shouldn't present much of a problem. I've seen a small window in the house, and it should be easy to get to the house through it. If anything goes wrong, I may be forced to kill the guards to get inside the house.
text.t9=I found a letter in Rheims's house where he tells someone to wait for him in a certain place while he is preparing a big expedition. What is he talking about? A couple of minutes after I got inside the house, two cutthroats broke into the house, and I had to fight with them and kill them. It's strange that they said I am the third person who tried to sneak into Rheims's house. However that may be, I have lost track of Rheims, and now I'll have to return to Silehard to report my failure.
text.t10=I killed the guards and got inside the house. Now we'll see what I can find here.
text.t11=Governor Silehard reacted rather mildly when I reported my failure. I thought he'd be upset. He even paid me the rest of the money for this mission. Perhaps Lady Fortune smiles on me.
text.t12=I found out that Rheims really stayed on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#, and he spent most of the time in the #sQuebradas Costillas# tavern. I suppose I should talk to the owner of the tavern. I am sure she has something worthwhile she could tell me.
text.t13=The pirate who could tell me about the location of Rheims is dead. I guess I don't have any other choice but to sail to every island to find him. I doubt that Rheims would sail to any English colony because it's too dangerous for him.
text.t14=Rheims hasn't been on #sisland_Douwesen# island recently. The last time he was here was several months ago. What's interesting, though, is that he paid for everything with Indian golden coins.
text.t15=I was at #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle# and learned that no one has seen Rheims there.
text.t16=Rheims hasn't been at #sFalaise de Fleur# on #sisland_Falaise de Fleur#. My only consolation is that now there are only a few places where Rheims could be.
