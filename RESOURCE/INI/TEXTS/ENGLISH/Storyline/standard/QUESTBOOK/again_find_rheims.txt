title=Continue searching for Rheims.
text.t1=What a surprise! I've met Danielle with a fellow named Vincent at the researcher's house. It turned out that she is also looking for Rheims, and that Vincent helped her locate him. Danielle doesn't mind if I join her and Vincent in search of Rheims. We decided to meet up at the researcher's house in a couple of days. Now I need to get to Silehard in order to tell him that the captive escaped. I also want to let him know that I finally found traces of Rheims. Danielle also wants to settle her affairs.
text.t2=I told the governor that I know where Rheims is hiding. He was happy about that and ordered me to find Rheims and take him to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#. Now all I have to do is find that poor fellow with the help of Danielle and Vincent.
text.t3=I sailed back to #sisland_Oxbay# where I met Danielle. She told me that Vincent got the information that Rheims is on #sisland_Douwesen# island. We are on our way there now.
text.t4=As soon as we arrived at #sisland_Douwesen#, Danielle and I went to the tavern where Vincent was waiting for us. He pointed out Rheims, who was sitting there at the tavern, and then he left. We talked to Rheims, and he invited us to come to his house outside the city.
text.t5=As soon as we got outside the city, some cutthroats attacked us. Danielle and Rheims ran to Rheims's house while I stayed to fight with our attackers. I settled our dispute, and now I have to go to the jungle. When I see the first fork on the road, I have to go straight, and when I see the second fork, I should turn to the left.
text.t6=What on earth? Rheims and Vincent are dead, and Danielle seems to be hysterical!
text.t7=That hurts! That crazy girl stuck her dagger in me when I tried to figure out what was going on. Rheims was mortally wounded, and from their talk with Danielle, it appears that Silehard is the one who ordered Rheims killed. What's more - he ordered Rheims killed because Rheims had discovered some treasures. Vincent was a killer in Silehard's service. Oh, dear! To think I served such a rascal! I have to find Danielle now and convince her that I am not to blame.
text.t8=What a surprise! I've met Danielle with a fellow named Barbossa at the researcher's house. It turned out that she is also looking for Rheims, and that Barbossa helped her locate him. Danielle doesn't mind if I join her and Barbossa in search of Rheims. We decided to meet up at the researcher's house in a couple of days. Now I need to get to the Governor in order to tell him that the captive escaped. I also want to let him know that I finally found traces of Rheims. Danielle also wants to settle her affairs.
text.t9=I told the governor that I know where Rheims is hiding. He was happy about that and ordered me to find Rheims and take him to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#. Now all I have to do is find that poor fellow with the help of Danielle and Barbossa, but I need to go to #sisland_Antigua# first.
text.t10=I sailed back to #sisland_Oxbay# where I met Danielle. She told me that Barbossa got the information that Rheims is on #sisland_Douwesen# island. We are on our way there now.

text.t12=That hurts! That crazy girl stuck her dagger in me when I tried to figure out what was going on. Rheims was mortally wounded, and from their talk with Danielle, it appears that the Governor is the one who ordered Rheims killed. What's more - he ordered Rheims killed because Rheims had discovered some treasures. It looks like Barbossa was a killer in the Governor's service. Oh, dear! To think I served such a rascal! I have to find Danielle now and convince her that I am not to blame.
