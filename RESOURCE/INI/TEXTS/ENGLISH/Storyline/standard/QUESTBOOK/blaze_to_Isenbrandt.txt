title=Deliver a letter to a pirate chief.
text.t1=The Governor Silehard charged me with delivering a letter to a certain Izenbrandt Jurksen who is a pirate chief. In that letter the governor says that he'll reward anyone who can find and kill Rheims. After completing the mission, I'll have to return to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# to get another mission.
text.t2=I can't say that Jurksen gave me a very hearty welcome. Nonetheless, I gave him the letter. It's interesting - Jurksen mentioned that the governor has used his services many times. Now I am going to sail back to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# and tell the governor that I completed his mission.
