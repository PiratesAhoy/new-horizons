title=Rescue Captaine Chevalles' crew
text.t1=I met the famous French pirate Capitaine Chevalle in the #sPort au Prince# tavern. Due to some excessive bad luck, he has lost both his ship and his crew. I agreed to bring him to #sisland_Redmond# and help him release his crew from the English. In return, both he and his crew will join my own sailors. I can't sail into #sRedmond# with Chevalle onboard though. He might get recognized for being a fugitive pirate. Instead we'll make berth at one of the shores. Devil's Throat would be a good place.
text.t2=The shore wasn't as safe as I thought. We were met by a patrol of English soldiers when we landed there. I hope we will encounter no additional patrols on our way through the jungle. We must get to #sRedmond# as soon as we can.
text.t3=Apparently the execution is just about to begin. We must get to the church immediately!
text.t4=Chevalle and I managed to release the crew. We'd better get back to the beach and leave this island though. And who is Jean-Bart?
text.t5=We were met with a English ambush on our way back to the ship. Fortunately they failed to kill us. We'd better go to the ship quickly and get away from this island.
text.t6=I wanted to have gone to some pirate port, but apparently there's still one crewmember missing. Jean-Bart Lafin escaped shortly after Chevalle and most likely went to #sisland_Aruba#. We should go there and find out if anybody has seen him. Jean-Bart wanted to find a ship to leave the island, so there's probably a sailor in #sOranjestad# port who has seen him.
text.t7=We have found a good Samaritan at the port who has helped Jean-Bart. He probably wouldn't have survived in #sOranjestad# without this man. Jean-Bart is currently out for a stroll outside the town. We are going to see if we can find him.
text.t8=The hardest part is finally over. We agreed to go to the #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# pirate settlement now to discuss my future partnership with Capitaine Chevalle.
text.t9=On arrival at #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# pirate settlement, we were cornered by a bunch of East India Trading Company officers sent by Beckett. We dealt with them quickly though. After that small delay, I accepted Chevalle and his crew, including Jean-Bart, to join my own men. I think they can be of much use to me in the future.
text.t10=On arrival at #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# pirate settlement, we were cornered by a bunch of East India Trading Company officers sent by Beckett. We dealt with them quickly though. After that small delay, I told chevalle to go his own way. He is a good pirate, but I'm afraid that I'll keep encountering English soldiers and EITC officials as long as he's with me.
text.t11=On arrival at #sTortuga#, Capitiane Chevalle disappeared somewhere in town before I left ship. I should check at the local tavern to see if anyone has seen him.
text.t12=John Adams the local tavern keeper on #sTortuga# said that he overheard that a Frenchman had been seen going into the local Brothel, worth a look I guess.
text.t13=I met Captaine Chevalle at the #sPort au Prince# tavern. He needed my help to save his crew. I declined though. A rescue mission at #sisland_Redmond# seems too perilous to me.
text.t14=John Adams the local tavern keeper on #sTortuga# said that he overheard that a Frenchman had been seen going into the local Townhall, worth a look I guess.
