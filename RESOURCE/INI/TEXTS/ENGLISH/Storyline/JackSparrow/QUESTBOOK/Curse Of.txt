title=The Curse of the #scursed_ship#.
text.t1=I have met Bootstrap Bill's son Will. He had the last cursed coin of Barbossa's treasure, but I think Elizabeth Swann has it now. Will and I must go to #sTortuga# off the island #sisland_Hispaniola# and get organised to get it and the #scursed_ship# back.
text.t2=It appears there actually is a curse involed with the treasure of Cortez. The #scursed_ship# and its crew that Barbossa stole from me appear to now all be cursed.
text.t3=I was right to make port at #sTortuga#. I found Mr Gibbs and I hired some sailors. The only small drawback is I promised to give the Interceptor to Anamaria. However, by then I expect to get back the #scursed_ship#. So for me, the Interceptor will be no use. Now, I have to go to Isla de Muerta to find Barbossa and Elizabeth Swann. 
text.t4=What misfortune! For the second time, I'm marooned by Barbossa AND this time I have to put up with Elizabeth. Despite I lost the Interceptor and my crew, I have to find a solution to reach Isla de Muerta. I should execute the Elizabeth's advice and explore this islet. 
text.t5=After meeting Norrington on the islet, I sailed aboard the Dauntless up to Isla de Muerta. The marines defeated Barbossa's crew meanwhile in the cave I killed Barbossa thanks to Will and Elizabeth's help. Unfortunately, the Bristish authorities didn't forget my past and sentenced me to hanging. However, Will saved my life and helped me to run away from #sRedmond# fort. I met Mr Gibbs at Rocky Shore waiting for me. He explained how he got back the #scursed_ship#. After all, I can now sail my favourite ship again, maybe I should sail to #sTortuga# off #sisland_Hispaniola# and see if anyone wants help.
