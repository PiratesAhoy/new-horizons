title=The El Diablo's coming back
text.t1=The Spanish authorities didn't waste much time to find me. They knew I lived in #sisland_Douwesen# before working for them and they sent a ship at once here. Thanks to the Governor' soldiers, we ambushed and killed most of the enemy crew at Crab Cliffs. However, it seems the Captain hasn't accompanied his men. He must be aboard the ship. Let's go to Palm Beach!
text.t2=Chico Cois was the Captain of the 'El Diablo'! I won the duel but I didn't kill him because of our former friendship. I hid him in the hold and maintained to the Dutch Governor I had killed the captain. Now, I can leave #sisland_Douwesen# with my former ship and free Chico. I think Bahia de San Antonio in Cuba is the right place for releasing him.
text.t3=Done! Chico is free. He swore he wouldn't try to arrest me... It could be the last time I see him. Now, what's my next destination? Why not #sRedmond#? I know Captain Henry Morgan works for the English Governor. Maybe, he could accept me in one of his expeditions...
