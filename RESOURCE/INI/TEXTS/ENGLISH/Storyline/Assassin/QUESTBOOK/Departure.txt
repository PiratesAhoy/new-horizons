title=A Bad Deal
text.t1=I've been captain and smuggler for a few months and I don't regret my previous life as a soldier. Many years of this miserable life only allowed me to save enough money to buy a barque. Since I've become a smuggler, my business is improving day after day. Today I've got the juicy mission of delivering a cargo of ale to #sisland_Cuba#. A profit of 25,000 gold coins. My sleeping partner, who I met a few days ago, said all I have to do is deliver it to a Spanish merchant named Baltazar Salgada in Playa de Sabana. In short, this mission is just a piece of cake!
text.t2=I can't believe I was arrested by the Spaniards. Many days passed in the jail and I didn't know what would be my fate until I met the Vice-Admiral of #sHavana#. For avoiding the plague I've had to accept cholera! Working ten years for the Spanish.. Nice future... I will have time to think about this. For now, I need to meet Captain Damski in the shipyard before joining my new officer in the port.
text.t3=I met my new officer, Chico Cois. He seems to be competent at first glance and the crew are loyal to him. However, although his task is to help me, I'm sure he won't hesitate to kill me if I betray the Vice-Admiral. Anyway, my priority now is to accomplish the mission. I'll start on the island #sisland_Cayman# in #sCayman# port.
