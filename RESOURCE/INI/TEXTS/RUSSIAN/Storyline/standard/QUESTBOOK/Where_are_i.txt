title=To #sIsla Muelle#.
text.t1=A terrible storm blew up as soon as I put to sea. I struggled to save my ship for several hours before I was washed overboard. When I came to my senses, I found myself on #sisland_Douwesen#, but my ship and my crew have disappeared.
text.t2=The tavern-keeper in #sDouwesen# said that my ship hasn't made it to port. And now I am in trouble. I don't have any money, I don't have my ship, but somehow I must get to #sIsla Muelle# to meet Danielle. Maybe I should hire aboard some ship. The tavern-keeper mentioned that the pirates who live in the jungle hire some sailors to work on their ships.
text.t3=At the pirate's den, I found out that a certain Anacleto Rui Sa Pinto is in the tavern, hiring some sailors for his crew.
text.t4=Anacleto said that he serves as his own captain, but he could hire me as a ordinary sailor. However, a little later Anacleto offered to let me fight with one big fellow to prove I was worthy to captain his ship.
text.t5=I killed the brute - but the faithless Anacleto broke his word, and now he refuses to take me aboard his ship.
text.t6=I was forced to kill the scoundrel Anacleto and capture his ship. Now I can sail to #sisland_Isla Muelle# to meet Danielle, or I can try to find my ship and my crew. If my fellows are alive, they are probably on one of the nearby islands.
text.t7=I got lucky. A certain Wilfred Bythesea tells me he is my old friend (well... perhaps I remember him... and perhaps not) and offered to give me his ship in exchange for one service. Needless to say, I agreed! Now I can sail to #sisland_Isla Muelle# in order to meet Danielle, or I can try to find my ship and my crew. If my fellows are alive, they are probably on one of the nearby islands.
text.t8=Anacleto agreed to take me to #sIsla Muelle# but I'll have to pay him for his services when we get there. I hope Danielle is still there.
text.t9=That scoundrel deceived me! After we left #sisland_Douwesen# we have taken wrong course. When I demanded an explanation, he informed me that he planned to sell me to work in the mines! It's lucky that I managed to win the crew over to my side, and now the ship is mine.
text.t10=That rascal deceived me! After we left #sisland_Douwesen# we have taken wrong course. When I demanded an explanation, he informed me that he planned to sell me to work in the mines! His filthy crew locked me in the ship's prison, but I managed to set myself free and even recover my belongings. When we were very close to #sisland_Oxbay# I jumped overboard. Luckily I wasn't far from the shore.
text.t11=When I got to #sisland_Oxbay#, I discovered that Danielle wasn't there yet. I suspect she is in trouble, so I am going to find her and help her. I recall that she was going to sail to #sisland_Isla Muelle#.
text.t12=When I got to #sisland_Oxbay#, I found out that Danielle wasn't there yet. I suspect she is in trouble, so I am going to find her and help her. I recall that she was going to sail to the #sisland_Isla Muelle#. Since I don't have my own ship, and since the researcher's 'yacht' turned out to be just a ... it's not going to be easy to find her.
