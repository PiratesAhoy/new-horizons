title=Escort a ship with troops to #sisland_Oxbay# and then meet an agent.
text.t1=My second task is to escort the sloop 'Albion' to #sGreenford# on #sisland_Oxbay#. There is a regiment of English soldiers who are going to harass the French. A local citizen of #sGreenford# will show me a landing place, and will guide them to a cave discovered on the island. When I am done with that mission, I'll have to sneak into the captured town of #sOxbay# and meet there a certain English agent. The captain of the sloop is waiting for me by the port's entrance.
text.t2=I talked to Ewan Glover who is the captain of the sloop 'Albion'. He said that he is ready to put to sea at any moment, and as soon as I'm on board my ship, he'll join me.
text.t3=What a naive person that governor is! This is a golden opportunity to turn pirate. Unfortunately, I'll hardly be able to complete Silehard's mission. I'll have to come up with a story about the French attack... or perhaps the pirate's attack.... I hope no one will suspect anything, but, if someone does, then we'll see what happens.
text.t4=Most unfortunate. During the voyage we ran into trouble. Despite all my efforts, the sloop 'Albion' sank. Poor Ewan, he seemed such a nice fellow. A thousand devils! I failed the first part of the governor's mission.
text.t5=What a wise decision Silehard made when he employed me. We safely arrived at #sisland_Oxbay# and are in #sGreenford#'s harbor, and the 'Albion' now lies under the protection of #sGreenford#. Now I should find that local citizen who'll show us the way to the cave.
text.t6=That local fellow named Wilfred found me himself. He said that we should land soldiers at night on a small deserted beach so the French wouldn't sniff out our operation. The beach is to the south-west from #sGreenford#'s harbor. We must sail west around the island and right behind the lonely rock we'll see at the beach. Wilfred will wait for us there.
text.t7=I found a little surprise when I came to the place where I agreed to meet with Wilfred. The French patrol appeared at the beach and I had to fight with them. Luckily, not a single French soldier managed to escape and give the alarm. Then Wilfred took our soldiers to the cave, then Ewan Glover and I returned to #sGreenford# where we bid farewell to each other. It's time to start on the second part of the mission.
text.t8=A thousand devils!!! Just as we approached our destination, it was God's will that the sloop 'Albion' sloop should be lost. Alas, now I need to sneak into #sOxbay# and try to find Tobias there.
text.t9=I met Tobias at the #sOxbay# tavern, and he told me that he managed to bribe one of the captains of the French squadron. Unfortunately, while we were talking, several French guards rushed into the tavern, and I had to fight to avoid being captured.
text.t10=After the shipwright named Oweyn Mc Dorey hid us from the French soldiers, Tobias told me that he needs to meet up with a captain, Rabel Yverneau, today. He is supposed to wait for Tobias at the tavern, but Tobias wants to meet at another location, and I must inform Rabel about that.
text.t11=It looks like we'll have to escape from here on Rabel's ship. I'll have to get back to #sRedmond# harbor on #sisland_Redmond# for my ship.
text.t12=I escaped from the French squadron, returned to the governor and got the gold I earned. The governor decided that I should take part in the liberation of #sOxbay# on #sisland_Oxbay#. I can't say that I very happy about his decision. Of course, I've no objection to a little fighting...but not for the English crown. I'm to be informed when our squadron will put to sea. In the meantime I can do as I wish. As His Serene Highness recommends, I am going to go and check out the local tavern, hehehe!
