title=Sao Feng's lost his bodyguards.
text.t1=I got captured by Mr. Mercer (one of Cutler Beckett's men) for sailing under false colours when saving the 'Montanez' near #sisland_Cuba#. He decided to tail us to see if we were Spanish and saw us changing flags when approaching #sisland_Redmond#. When he found out he had caught me of all people, he sent me straight to prison. Luckily for me Mergildo Hurtado saw Mercer, and was able to save me. I guess that Beckett knows that the Black Pearl is indeed the Wicked Wench now.
text.t2=The governor of Singapore, Sao Feng (A pirate lord) asked me to investigate and find the ones who've kidnapped his bodyguards Lian and Park. I refused. I don't want to get involved in this strange affair.
text.t3=The governor of Singapore, Sao Feng (A pirate lord) asked me to investigate and find the ones who've kidnapped his bodyguards Lian and Park and promised to pay me well if I succeed. The only thing I know is that a captain of a merchant ship saw a mysterious corvette in the morning, sailing away from the island's bay. The captain is in the tavern now, and I plan to begin my investigation by talking with him.
text.t4=I talked to Sao Feng's first mate and found out that he did indeed encounter a large black corvette with red sails, leaving Singapore. He said it looked like it was heading towards #sisland_Guadeloupe#.
text.t5=I got captured by Mr. Mercer (one of Cutler Beckett's men) for sailing under false colours when trying to save the 'Montanez' near #sisland_Cuba#. He decided to tail us to see if we were Spanish and saw us changing flags when approaching #sisland_Redmond#. When he found out he had caught me of all people, he sent me straight to prison. I am now waiting for Beckett and to be hung.
text.t6=I was most fortunate to talk to the navigator of the ship attacked by the pirate corvette. He said that the name of the corvette is 'Crimson Blood', and it was headed for #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# after it couldn't catch his ship. More pirates; lucky me.
text.t7=Alas, I am out of luck, all I managed to find out in the pirate's den is that the pirate corvette really was here, and that the members of the corvette's crew even killed someone on the seashore. Perhaps I should ask one of the wharf rats; they may have seen the killing.
text.t8=Father Bernard in #sRedmond#'s church on #sisland_Redmond# hired me to deliver a letter to Padre Domingues. At first sight, the mission seemed quite simple. However, one messenger has already been killed in the city by some people in masks. I suspect that the fellows from that mysterious pirate corvette have something to do with it.
text.t9=I came to #sisland_Isla Muelle#'s shore, just as Father Bernard told me to. I was surprised to find some fellows waiting for me there.
text.t10=Some strange people proposed that I give them the letter to read in return for 1000 gold, saying that they will return the letter after reading it. I refused, so they drew their weapons.... Afterwards, on their dead bodies I found some strange medallions.
text.t11=Some strange people proposed that I give them the letter to read in return for 1000 gold, saying that they will return the letter after reading it. They returned the letter with the seal still on it, but it seems to me that it doesn't look like the original seal.
text.t12=Padre Domingues suspected that the letter was opened and then closed with another seal. I told him the truth. Thanks be to God it all ended well.
text.t13=Padre Domingues suspected that the letter was opened and then closed with another seal. But I insisted I was innocent. Then he said some things about God's redemption, or something like that. It doesn't matter. I don't like the fathers, anyway.
text.t14=After I gave the letter to Padre Domingues, I got another mission. I'm to meet the barque 'Montanez' near #sisland_Cuba# and guide her to #sisland_Isla Muelle#.
text.t15=Oh, dear. When I arrived at #sisland_Cuba#, the 'Montanez' was already sunk by some ships without any identification. I'll have to return to Padre Domingues empty-handed.
text.t16=I arrived just in time! When I reached #sisland_Cuba#, the 'Montanez' was close to sinking, under attack by two ships without any identification. I've dealt with them.
text.t17=Surprisingly, 'Montanez' stopped briefly on #sisland_Cuba# in the town #sSantiago#. From speaking with her captain, I learned that he had to deliver some passenger there. Now I think it's time to sail to #sisland_Isla Muelle#.
text.t18=As I suspected, the padre is none too happy with the loss of this barque. Nonetheless, he didn't blame me.
text.t19='Montanez' is anchored near #sIsla Muelle# on #sisland_Isla Muelle#. Padre Domingues seems to be very glad. It looks like something quite valuable is on this barque.
text.t20=My next mission is to deliver a letter to Father Bernard in #sRedmond#'s church on #sisland_Redmond#, and to watch out, because nobody but Father Bernard should read this letter.
text.t21=They waited for me near the exit from the church. They looked just like those strange people on #sisland_Isla Muelle#'s shore. Not sure where they got the idea that I had to give them the letter, but foolishly they drew their weapons. How many more are there of these masked devils, and what is this cause they are so willing to die for?
text.t22=The letter is delivered now, and I received the reward I deserved. And now I know who is trying to stop me. Father Gareth. Who could predict that? But now he has attacked me, in the church.
text.t23=My new mission is to find the Satanists' lair. The Church will give me a great reward, but more importantly, these Satanists have kidnapped women from Singapore, and I suspect they also are responsible for Padre Domingues' disappearance. I think I will start my investigation in the #sIsla Mulle# tavern on #sisland_Isla Muelle#. Maybe somebody there knows something about Padre Domingues' disappearance.
text.t24=Now I know the identity of the passenger of the 'Montanez'. It is a Maltese knight, Jaoquin de Masse, who arrived here to help us to defeat a Satanist band. He looks like an experienced warrior.
text.t25=After speaking with the innkeeper, I learned that a person who calls himself 'Stallion', has arrived here. This 'Stallion' has great influence upon the local youth, and, in particular, upon one Jordano, the son of the local cooper. And by a strange coincidence, Jordano's father has died under very suspicious circumstances. I should have a talk with this Jordano.
text.t26=I've found Jordano without any trouble. Seems to have a lot of influence over the local youths, and I suppose that makes sense, since he's a bit older. He told me that this 'Stallion' has left #sIsla Muelle# for #sGreenford#, on #sisland_Oxbay#. Off to #sGreenford#'s tavern again, to talk to that fountain of knowledge of things unusual - Simon the tavernkeeper.
text.t27=I know that the man I am searching for is in #sGreenford#'s prison.
text.t28=The commandant of #sGreenford# prison wouldn't let me see the prisoner. It appears I have no choice but to sail for #sRedmond#'s church on the island of #sisland_Redmond# to ask Father Bernard to give me a letter, granting me access to the prisoner.
text.t29=A return to #sisland_Redmond# will take too long. I tried another plan. I intimidated the weak-willed fellow into giving me access to the prisoner. But I suspect this incident will cause my relationship with England to suffer.
text.t30=I found another way to get to the prisoner. It was simple - I just paid 5000 gold, and all obstacles disappeared.
text.t31=At my insistence, the captain let me in.
text.t32=The only way to find the lair, where the women hopefully are, was to set the prisoner free, and I did it. Now to #sisland_Turks# and solve the mystery. I hope I can find those women before it's too late...
text.t33=Father Bernard gave me a letter setting the #sGreenford# prisoner on #sisland_Oxbay# free, although he seemed amused by my request.
text.t34=I'm too intimidating for my own good! I decided to question the prisoner in the cell, but oops, he died. I hardly touched him! Before he died though, he said something about #sisland_Turks#. Maybe the lair is somewhere on the island?
text.t35=The 'Stallion' believed that I was a member of his group, and told me where to find the lair. His death was quick. And all that remains is to travel to White Reefs on #sisland_Turks# and travel through the jungle to see if I can find those women and Padre Domingues.
text.t36=I better leave Singapore quickly. I stole a considerable ammount of Sao Feng's money and not to mention the honour he will loose if anyone finds out what I did with his bodyguards. 
text.t37=With the destruction of the masked band, including their master (who was no easy opponent). My problems are solved. 'Crimson Blood', the corvette everyone reported, was waiting for me in the bay.
text.t38=The bartender at the #sGreenford# Tavern told me that since the warden is dead, I should just go into the prison and speak with the 'Stallion.' 
text.t39=Talked with a wharf rat on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#; the kidnappers on the 'Crimson Blood' are somehow tied in with Father Bernard, the priest in #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#.  I've been warned not to trust him, but I still need what information he might give.  Perhaps I should offer to help him with something so as to gain his trust in me, before I ask about the 'Crimson Blood'.  Who knows?  Am I an optimist to hope there will be some money in it for me?
text.t40=The masked devils got Padre Domingues too. This is turning out to be some adventure. I still have this letter to deliver to Father Bernard, so it's off to #sisland_Redmond# again.
text.t41=I have the women onboard! Domingues is back where he belongs; now to sail to Father Bernard on #sisland_Redmond# to report and collect my reward from the church, and then to Singapore to drop off the women to Sao Feng.
text.t42=Talked with a wharf rat on #sisland_Quebradas Costillas#; the kidnappers on the 'Crimson Blood' are somehow tied in with Father Bernard, the priest in #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond#.  I've been warned not to trust him, but I still need what information he might give.  I have already helped out him and his church with finding out about the priest on #sGreenford#, Perhaps I can ask about the 'Crimson Blood' as I have already done enough to gain trust.  Who knows?  Am I an optimist to hope there will be some money in it for me from the church as well?
