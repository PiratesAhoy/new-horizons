title=Battle Royale
text.t1=The admiral in #sSt John's# was most upset when I showed him the French plans for the assault on #sRedmond#. He doesn't have a force capable of taking on the '#swarship#'. So he wants me to sail to #sRedmond# and evacuate the governor.
text.t2=The admiral in #sSt John's# has paid me what he owed. What next? By now #svillain# will have finished whatever he was up to at #sSantiago#, and anyway if I sail there, I may be too late for whatever is going on at #sRedmond#.
text.t3=#sgovernor# believes, as do I, that if the French succeed in taking #sRedmond#, their next target will be #sSantiago#. So he wants me to assist with the defence of #sRedmond#.
text.t4=#sgovernor# believes, as do I, that if the French succeed in taking #sRedmond#, their next target will be #sSantiago#. So he wants me to assist with the defence of #sRedmond#. And he's helping me by sending a couple of fast galleons to accompany me.
text.t5=By the time I reached #sisland_Antigua#, the French had already succeeded in capturing #sRedmond#. Perhaps I should sail to #sSantiago# to see if #sgovernor# has anything interesting for me to do.
text.t6=By the time I reached #sSantiago#, the French had already succeeded in capturing #sRedmond#. Their next target is probably #sSantiago#. So I am to visit the admiral in #sHavana# in case he has any ideas for the defence of #sSantiago# which could earn me some gold.
text.t7=#sgovernor# is more than willing to be evacuated from #sRedmond#! He's bringing his wife out, too. And he's promised me plenty of money for getting them to safety. The French are already attacking, so it's time to get back to the ship.
text.t8=The '#swarship#' is mine! And #svillain# was aboard. I killed #spronoun2# in a duel.
text.t9=We sank the '#swarship#'. According to some of the survivors, #svillain# was aboard, but #spronoun# was not among the prisoners. Perhaps #spronoun# went down with the ship, but it's not that far to #sisland_Redmond#. I suspect we have not seen the last of #spronoun2#.
text.t10=#sgovernor# changed the deal. Instead of sailing off to some place of safety, I'm to help relieve #sRedmond# fort. There's a lot more money for doing that, so I agreed.
text.t11=The commander of #sRedmond# fort had a couple of soldiers escort me to the governor's residence. Very nice of him, but I suspect he wasn't entirely sure whose side I was on and wanted to be certain what I was up to.
text.t12=Not a bad day's work! I'm a lot richer, and England thinks I'm a hero for saving #sRedmond#. I bet the governor of #sSantiago# will have something nice to say too, as the French probably intended to attack there after taking #sRedmond#.
text.t13=#svillain# did indeed survive the sinking of the '#swarship#' and tried to take #sgovernor# hostage. I managed to persuade #svillain# to fight me, then killed #spronoun2#.
text.t14=I bet the governor of #sRedmond# will be grateful for our defeat of the French attack! Hopefully he'll express that gratitude with a big bag of gold.
text.t15=The governor of #sRedmond# had better have a nice reward for our defeat of the French attack! If not, I've got the '#swarship#' now...
text.t16=Governor #sgovernor# rewarded me with a bag of gold.
text.t17=Governor #sgovernor# was sufficiently please with my victory to give me a Spanish Letter of Marque.
text.t18=Governor #sgovernor# was happy I'd saved #sSantiago# and promoted me by way of a reward.
text.t19=Governor #sgovernor# was so pleased with the defeat of the French that he offered the hand of #sromance# in marriage. I was delighted to accept.
text.t20=Governor #sgovernor# offered me a Spanish Letter of Marque as a reward, but I rejected it. I don't want to be in Spain's service.
text.t21=Governor #sgovernor# offered me the hand of #sromance# in marriage, but I declined. I'm not interested in such a relationship.
text.t22=The galleons assigned to me by #sassigner# have left. Evidently their captains have lost patience with me.
text.t23=#sadmiral# does not believe he can prevent the French invasion of #starget#, so I am to go there and evacuate the governor.
text.t24=#sgovernor# has no intention of leaving #sSantiago#. He intends to remain and lead the town's defence. Instead, I am to keep #sromance# out of harm's way until the battle is over, one way or another.
text.t25=Now to return to #sgovernor# with the good news - he doesn't need to defeat the French attack because I've done it for him.
text.t26=#svillain# was brought aboard my ship and faced me in my cabin. I killed #spronoun2# in a duel.
text.t27=#sgovernor# wants me to go to the Havana admiralty. #sadmiral# may have plans for the defence of #sSantiago#, and if I can get involved in those plans, there may be a reward in it for me.
